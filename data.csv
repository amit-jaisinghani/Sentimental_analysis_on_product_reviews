"BUYER BEWARE if you plan to buy this for the PHILLIPS HUE SYSTEM.","I want to start off by saying that I love Amazon as a company, so this isn't a hate review on Amazon. BUT, I do feel deceived by amazon on this.The Echo Plus does have a smart hub that uses Zigbee to connect to various smart home devices. HOWEVER, the Echo Plus can only utilize the PHILLIPS HUE system in a limited capacity. In order to get full use out of the HUE bulbs, you still have to buy the HUE BRIDGE.What you can do with the Echo Plus alone:1. Voice Control the lights.2. Change the color of the lights by voice, BUT you are limited to about 20 colors instead of the 16 million colors that the HUE bulbs are capable of.3. You can set routines and groups, which is nice.What you CANT do without the HUE Bridge:1. Compatibility with many more sensors2. The ability to automate and set scenes3. get system updates over the air and future features.4. Have your lights sync with music5. Probably more, but I can't remember.Also, if you change devices, or switch to a HUE hub, odds are you will have to redo all of your lights.What bothers me more than anything is that the product page for the Echo Plus CLEARLY states compatibility with the HUE system, and even use the HUE APP logo as shown in the picture. That's great, except that you MUST have a HUE BRIDGE to use the app, which is another $50-60 on top of the already expensive investment of the bulbs.CraigI would like to see Amazon clarify that the HUE BRIDGE is necessary for the full HUE system, but I doubt it will happen. Alternatively, I would to see them bundle the Echo Plus and HUE together so that you can get the full system right out of the box.Hope this helps,Craig M","neutral"
"Great Device with Impressive Audio","Short & Sweet - For what it is, this device is amazing. Performance is quick, audio is great, and the built-in Zigbee hub works quite well.Longer Review;After dragging my heels for over a year, I finally bought our first Echo (2nd Generation) back in August. I loved it so much that I got us 2 more for other areas in the house. Being able to group them and play the same music or audio throughout the house is a novelty that won't grow old for me. I've only wished that they had a little more full sound, especially at higher volume. I'd considered the last Echo Plus, but the average of reviews I read didn't make it appear to perform significantly better than our already great 2nd Generation Echos.When I saw this new Echo Plus listed, I pre-ordered it to replace the Heather Grey Echo in our kitchen and move that one to our bedroom. We tend to have music playing in the kitchen more than any other room, and I wanted slightly better sound than the regular Echo in there. I'm honestly glad we took a chance on this device without any reviews to go by.Appearance;As you can see in the photos, it's pretty much identical in height to the 2nd Generation Echo. It is a bit wider to accommodate the larger speakers, and the top is slightly domed instead of being flat. A similar 7-microphone array is on top and they seem to work just as well. There also appears to be a tripod-style connector on the base of the unit.Setup;Setup was surprisingly easy as this Echo Plus detected our network settings on its own. I plugged it in, it did its initial startup, and then told me the device was connected. Simple as that.Audio compared to 2nd Generation Echo;Highs are clearer.Mids are more natural and better-defined.Lows are deeper.Overall volume is noticeably louder and sound quality is improved.When paired with our other Echos, music and audio is in sync everywhere and this device stands out above the others in audio performance.General Performance;We have a quick network and I don't notice any perceivable performance difference between this new Echo Plus and our regular 2nd Generation Echos. Everything seems to work as it should.I bought this with the free Philips Hue bulb promotion. This bulb is our first Zigbee device and works very well with the Echo Plus. It is easily controlled by either the Echo Plus or the other Echos we have in the house. I'll be keeping an eye out for deals on these bulbs in the future. Like our other Echos, it also has no problem controlling our Kasa Smart Plugs.Overall;While $150 is a lot for a single speaker, for what I was looking for, this thing excels. If you like the 2nd Generation Echo but hoped it sounded a bit better, I would highly recommend this. Based on what I've read, if you were disappointed with the audio performance with the 1st Generation Echo Plus but want everything else it had to offer, consider giving this wonderful speaker a try.P.S.: The internal ambient temperature sensor seems fairly accurate and nice to have included.","positive"
"If You Are Undecided .. Dont Be ... BUY THIS ECHO","I jumped on the Echo bandwagon as soon as the original was released a few years ago.  Loved it.  When the Echo Plus with Built in Hub was released in 2017 … Nice.  The hub gave me the luxury of controlling my garage door after buying Nexx Garage.  With these two Echo's - I also purchased the Amazon Voice Remote because the Echos did not have much range for listening around corners and from different rooms.  The Voice Remote was essential, but solved the issue.  I also added an Echo Dot in an obscure corner of the house for better Alexa coverage.When the Echo Plus with ZigBee (2nd Generation) was released in October 2018 … I stressed over whether I should take the plunge and add another.  Would it be that much better?  I DID buy it and I am soooooooo glad about my decision.PROS:  #1 - Pairing accessories with this latest version is easy and intuitive.  Everything works flawlessly.  My previous two Echos had me ranting in frustration when trying to add a smart home device. And most ended up being returned out of failure to pair.  #2 - The internal microphone is so finely tuned - I can call out commands from other rooms and even outside the house (when the windows are open) and Alexa responds perfectly.  #3 - THE SPEAKERS.  Oh the sound is phenomenol !!  Yet - I was going to call Amazon support because there was a rattle sound frequently from the speakers/unit when playing music.  I went next to the unit to record the rattle so I could play it for the tech rep when I called.  It was them that I realized the speakers were so dynamic - they were rattling my fine glassware that was in close proximity to the Echo.  Once the glassware was moved - the speakers are sensational and flawless.  I play Spotify all the time now.  It sounds wonderful on the new Echo !!!This 2nd Generation Echo is worth every penny and then some.  I now have my entire house paired with receptacles, light bulbs, my garage door opener and a Phillips Color Hue bulb.  Pairing and grouping everything was absolutely simple !!!  There is never a glitch in operating the accessories.  AND best of all - I know what I will be buying for family holiday gifts.","positive"
"Satisfying sound when paired, loud volume","I really like the sound on these two speakers combined. I have a Bose, which always outperformed other small sound systems for me, but the Echo 2nd Gen--although individually not quite as good soundwise as Bose--sounds just as good when the two speakers are paired, and along with the subwoofer slightly outperform the Bose. The trebles are clear and the bass isn't overwhelming, but it's a good solid sound and feel. There's a good balance between treble and bass and you can ask Alexa to decrease or increase both. The volume level can also get extremely loud, which I found has been lacking in most speakers this size. The setup can be a little glitchy with the Alexa app, which seems buggy and is not that user friendly when it comes to setting up and pairing, but even I, who is no tech wiz, was able to figure it out and finally pair everything up. I've tried so many  small speakers like this and have always been disappointed, so I'm glad I finally found some that live up to my expectations. Super happy I bought these. I'll definitely be keeping them.","positive"
"Nice sound","Not that the sound of the old 1st Gen Echo was bad, but the 2nd Gen is noticeably better. Deep, richer and perhaps even louder than the old. I did like the old volume control (turning the top of the device) as opposed to buttons (so 1990s), but since I rarely use that function, I can live with it. The only down I can think of is the smart home hub. I don't know what it is, how to use it, whether it can replace the ones I already own, or where to find information about it. I posted a question pre-sale, but never got a response. Maybe no one know, or perhaps it is not ready for prime time.BTW, I traded in the old one for a credit and it was worth the investment just because the sound is superior.","positive"
"CANNOT GET ZIGBEE HUB TO WORK","I Followed directions to get Hue bulb to connect. It came with the Echo and the directions say: To set up your free bulb, plug in and set up your Echo Plus, plug in your bulb, and ask, “Alexa, discover my devices. All I get is no devices found even when turning on skill in the app. I have a hue account set up and logged in. If you try to join the Hue app itself it said no bridge found. I asked Alexa  is Hub turned on and get no answer. I ask to turn Hub on same thing. I went and bought another HUE bulb and it does not work either. I bought this for THE HUB, but it does not seem to work. I'm sending back. On a side note most new home automation devices are WIFI now and do not need a hub. I just wanted to connect my older devices without an external hub.I like the idea, but if I would make one of these I would have made a hub that worked and would have included Z-wave in the hub as well.I'm sending back and ordering the ECHO without the hub. I also ordered a samsung gen 3 HUB to go with it and all will be good.I do think the ECHO with the better speaker design is a great Alexa device. I love Alexa and everything the dot and Echo do, I just think the Built it hub didn't work out for them so well.ADDITIONAL INFO: We even tried to connect our front door lock that was Zigbee and it would not connect in pairing mode. Tried several times and no luck. I think the HUB on the device I bought must be defective.I have been working with home automation since the first generation and are very familiar with programming. We also set up out own alarm system and camera system with automation and garage door control.","negative"
"Great new Amazon Alexa Echo","Wow, this Echo sounds great and the voice is so natural.  I bought a Dot at the same time for upstairs and it works great as well.  I plan on ordering 2 more Dot’s and I’m looking at buying a couple thermostats to take advantage of the built in hub for smart devices.","neutral"
"Value for money amazing product","I’m amazed with the speaker quality, improved bass and more louder. Loved it","positive"
"Extremely limited compared to Google Home stereo pairing","I was quite excited that Amazon had caught up to Sonos and Google and finally allowed stereo pairing of speakers. It’s amazing how much better two properly spaced speakers can sound, even without a sub. Unfortunately, Amazon decided to release this product without full feature parity of it’s competitors.As other reviews have mentioned, the stereo configuration ONLY works when streaming music from an online service. If you’re internet is out, or you want to take the speakers somewhere where no internet is available, you can only play from a single speaker at a time. That means local connection methods, like bluetooth and the 3.5mm aux in don’t play on a stereo pair (like they do with Google Home).I am really hoping this is a software kink that is quickly being worked out, and if support is added I’ll update this review. For now, I’m quite disappointed that I purchased a stereo pair of speakers and sub when half the time I only hear sound out of ONE of the three devices.Do yourself a favor and get a Google Home, Sonos, or if you don’t mind wires and want Alexa, get a Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 with an Echo Dot— much better stereo sound, lower price, and more functionality.","negative"
"Works great","Sounds great","positive"
"Works great!","Works great after setup but setup can be a little opaque.","positive"
"new echo","much better sound on the new echo","positive"
"Doesn't work like you'd expect. Waste of money and time.","This will not play both speakers except Amazon music. I tried for hours to get sound from TV with no luck. Showed to be connected, but no sound. Connected phone, but only 1 speaker played. Could control volume from either, but only got sound from one. Waste of money.","negative"
"Easy to setup - Easy to use - Great sound","I'm not techy and this was my first venture into the Smart Home world. I bought two (one for upstairs and one in the kitchen) and a 4-pack of Hue bulbs. Out of the box, this thing was super easy to setup, it basically did everything for me or gave clear instructions on what I needed to do. Linking the two Echos was a breeze in the app. Speaking of the app, creating groups and routines in the Alexa app is very easy and fun. I haven't manually turned on a lamp since! SOUND QUALITY IS BETTER THAN I IMAGINED FROM A DEVICE THIS SIZE. The sound coming out of this little thing really is impressive!PROS:1. Easy setup.2. Easy device integration. (Alexa, find my devices.) It doesn't get any easier than that.3. Responsive AI, even with my mid-western draw.4. GREAT SOUND QUALITY!The only CONS I have (and these are both pretty minor):1. I can't get my Bluetooth speaker to link when the Echo speakers are playing as a group (I think this is because each Echo speaker can only be linked to either another Echo or one Bluetooth device)2. If one speaker is playing music I can't get it to switch to the group for both speakers without stopping the music and restarting with a new command. (ex. I'd like to be able to say Alexa, play this song on Both Speakers. but that doesn't work; I have to say Alexa, stop. then Alexa, play [whatever music] on Both Speakers.)But both of those seem link minor things to me and not worth docking a star. I'd recommend this product for sure.","positive"
"Average Sound but amazing microphones","I mainly got this because I wanted a small speaker for my house that doesn't require my phone to play music. I work in the live sound/event field so I am really picky when it comes to speaker quality and already have a professional sound system in my house but rarely use it since I never feel like plugging my phone into it. I love the fact that I can simply say a song or artist and Alexa will play it even without using bluetooth or having my phone on me. I hate how with normal bluetooth speakers people can hear your phone ring and such if you have the sound on and are forced to put your iPhone into silent mode. That being said I was a little disappointed that most of the songs I wanted to hear weren't covered by the normal Prime membership and required me to upgrade my prime music subscription (why would they charge more for certain songs??). The sound quality itself I would say is average for a small bluetooth speaker. I was impressed by the bass and low end but vocals seem slightly muffled and could be a lot crisper. The microphone sensitivity on the new echo plus is really what impressed me most, being in the same room as the echo I can practically whisper and it still hears me perfectly. Even being multiple rooms away in another part of the house she hears me at a normal voice level. This was unexpected since I am used to having to shout at Siri with my iPhone right next to me. Overall even though its not amazing sound quality I feel like for only  $150 its a really good deal for all that it can do and if you are looking for amazing sound you should be spending a lot more.","neutral"
"Needs a better mic","Planed on replacing one of my dots with this in the living room. Felt like the dot could pick up when I said Alexa at a normal voice. With the plus I feel like I need to scream.","negative"
"Better sound, great connectivity, looks better, and turns on the lights","I am a huge fan of the Echo. I have the tap, the dot, the standard Echo and an Echo smart speaker, and now the plus.This one is definitely a step up. The best sound and response of all the previous models.In a nut shellThe dot is ok. Limited quality sound but small and unobtrusive. Nice for  a bedside alarm, weather information and morning news while shaving.The tap is the portable and battery powered option that I use in the morning. I listen to a streaming cable news show. I listen to it while in the shower, (it is not waterproof but I have a shelf far from water that it sits on), then while I shave, and I put it in the closet while getting ready and dressed. It's like a portable radio but it allows me to stream internet cable and listen to anything I want.The standard Echo and Echo with smart options is a great device. The addition of the smart features is ok. It allows you to turn on lights and fixtures, but going into a dark room and saying, Alexa, turn on lights! is not as easy as flipping a switch. It is ok for lights that are not near the bed and your heading to sleep. But, you'll wake people up by shouting the wake up command.This one is good for two reasons:1.) The sound is great. Better than the others.2.) I got a smart switch and can use it to turn on any number of devices. The hook up was easy and flawless.Also,Alexa is adding new skills. If you use a sound machine, she has a sound maker for sleeping. Wake up to the weather, the stock market, the news, a fact from history, and a joke of the day.If you are on the cusp of buying this device, making this your first Echo would be a great choice. If you have an Echo or tap, this is a good upgrade.","positive"
"Alexa is the Queen of Smart-homes!","It's hard to say everything she does so well, but the smart home hub is definitely the best par. Alexa, turn on the living room lights Alexa, turn the fireplace on Alexa, lock the front door ...are just a few of the commands we use everyday. There is no better smart home device on the market. Period.","positive"
"Same thing new look.","Couldn’t tell a difference between the “premium sound” and normal sound from our old echo plus. Literally just paying for a new look it seems like.","negative"
"Must have","Wonderful device.","positive"
"The biggest learning curve is understanding how Alexa pulls information and from where.","There are many bugs in the product that requires correcting, so I am happy to hear Amazon say Alexa is always learning. The Bluetooth connection breaks up when connecting to a my Macbookpro Bluetooth speaker. Invocations for Skills do not always work for some developers and Alexa does not pick up on this issue and recommends actions that is not related to the command.  When sending a command to open a radio station on one of the radio channels Alexa does not recognize the command and continuous to open to incorrect station.  Even though I send feedback to the app to indicate that it was the incorrect station, I continue to get the same results.  The system is not learning my most frequent commands.  But the sound is great, the system is practical for timing and mathematical conversions, the list function is GREAT! The biggest learning curve is understanding how Alexa pulls information and from where.  Once you learn the way to structure commands and where it should come from (i.e. Skills, Amazon Music...etc.) you can make good use of it. There were basic search engine requests given that Alexa didn't know.  This makes me wonder what search engine or data base is it pulling information from.  There shouldn't be any different between typing in the Google Search Engine and getting a result and asking Alexa a questions and getting a similar result.","negative"

"Would have been a five star BUT!","Great sound. Works well paired with a secondPlus and the sub woofer BUT....It came as a surprise to me that it does not work with my TV or the Fire Cube. Not a substitute for my sound bar.","neutral"
"Alexa hits another home run","I purchased this in a bundle and was happy when it finally all came in.  Yes, it did not come all together.  It paired without problems and updated itself in about 10 minutes.  The sound is rich and room filling with very little distortion.  Alexia responds and adjusts in a few seconds.  The sound is even better than the first which was good considering its limitations. This is the wilder,  louder and better sister.  LOL, I use it every day and have to say it is Awesome. If you have trouble pairing, delete the set and then recreate the set.  it works, A+  If this was helpful please indicate, I purchased this and use it daily.","positive"

"Awesome Echo Plus","Echo Plus surpassed my expectations","positive"
"Best smart home assistant.","Never had to call Alexa more than once. With the smart hub built in it is the best smart assistant device you can get if you want a smart home.","positive"
"Exceeded my expectations","I had been using a 2nd generation Dot in conjunction with an older Bose Bluetooth speaker which my spouse would run off with periodically, so when Amazon offered a good trade-in discount (and the Bose was missing again), I took advantage and ordered the sandstone speaker. I guess I was prepared to be disappointed in sound compared to the Bose, but this sounds great! Can’t really notice a difference! It’s nice not to have to separately turn the Bose on (how lazy is that?). It works great with the free Hue bulb,  though I had to power the bulb off and on again to put it into pairing mode, apparently, because the Echo couldn’t find it at first. I feel it’s a good value and I’m really happy with the purchase.","positive"
"Worthwhile after cumbersome set up","Once set up, amazing sound!  Make sure you have blue tooth activated, plug in echo plus, then click on settings and add device.  I connected both echo plus speakers and then the subwoofer for excellent surround sound.","neutral"
"Wrong One! Wrong Color","I got the wrong color and it was for a Birthday Gift and she’s  800 miles away from me! I always order through you for Christmas, Gifts and for her to get the wrong one was very upsetting!","negative"
"Echo plus great sound. Doesn’t pair simultaneously with standard echo and sub.","Four stars because I like the sound but minus one because you can’t add two different types of echos with the echo sub at the same time.  Two Like kind echos only sync simultaneously with the new echo sub. Epic fail for a technology company.","neutral"
"very nice with a couple small issues","to no surprise, the sleep timer doesn't work on this like the 2nd gen echo. I've been back and forth trying to get it fixed but it's something the devs have to fix and it's clear it'll take some time.however, the speaker quality is amazing on this. I watched a few shows and it sounded like I was in a movie theater. there is a super slight delay though (I'm using the line in feature, something new I believe - super useful, should have always been a feature).one last thing I find useful is the room temperature feature. I dunno if this was in the first echo plus, but it's nice to have.","neutral"
"Love it!","The sounds is great and it can hear me from across the room.","positive"
"not compatible","does not work with my wifi plugs like the Echo does","negative"
"Interesting","Easy to use and sounds better then the others.However, the light ring started turning green and and would a a pulsating thing. when I looked up what the color meant I read that either I was getting an incoming call or something was eavesdropping on me. immediately put it into do not disturb and after that I never saw the light again. I have multiple Alexa devices and have never had this happen.","neutral"
"Wonderful Sound!","So like most of the people here, setting up was a little frustrating and took about 30 minutes to figure out.  I did not have to download any update as my Alexa app was already updated.  Once I figured out how to pair all three speakers in the app, everything went smoothly and I LOVE the sound!  Even on lower sound levels, it's rich and wonderful.  For some reason, my old Alexa also plays in the group that I created - I have it in the Kitchen so there's music in the entire lower floor.  I really like the surround sound effect that the speakers create as well. I was a little hesitant buying two Echo Plus devices but I'm really glad that I did due to the sound quality and it's nice having a built in hub that can tell me the ambient temperature of the house.  I've already added a few Hue bulbs both upstairs and downstairs without a hitch and it's nice to be able to control them and my thermostat from my bedroom upstairs.  I highly recommend this combination from Amazon.  It's not super high-end but it doesn't have that price tag either.","positive"

"Surprisingly better sound than my first Echo.","I thought it would be hard to improve the sound from my first Echo in such a compact unit, but they accomplished that in this Echo plus. I have used the built in hub yet, because I mainly use it for music when I'm cooking. But I'm sure I'll eventually venture into the Alexa controlled gadgets before long. I'm completely satisfied so far and I don't expect that to change. If you're even thinking about buying one, go ahead and do it, you won't regret it. Thank you guys and God bless.","neutral"

"Great sound and better than Siri","I like the great sound quality and it’s a great improvement from our previous speaker setup where we had to use an aux cable. I think it looks great and is aesthetically pleasing. I don’t like the fact I cannot use YT music through it yet, because I’m sure they want to sell Amazon Premium Music subscriptions. But being a prime customer there is still a wide range of music access with no ads. I just enabled whisper mode yesterday and seems like that’s a great addition to keep the kids asleep.","positive"
"Great that we can pair them together.","After some troubleshooting, it turns out that one of my Echo Plus devices had a connection issue and was cutting out.

"We're having a lot of fun","Us kids gave Dad this echo plus to help him out. We ask it many questions. Play a little music on it. Have a lot of problem getting the old music. Usually when you ask Alexa for a song it brings up some modern garbage. We're working on the way we ask Alexa. We got the Phillips Hue in a few rooms and Dad just gets a kick out of the lights coming on just by talking. It helps us because I'm pushing him in a wheelchair. Mostly we're just having a lot of fun. I look forward to purchasing other items for Alexa. We got the echo dot 3rd gen. as well. Just one little complaint is that the microphone doesn't seem to be the best. Sometimes we have to outright yell at Alexa.","positive"
"Looks great in the living room","Very easy to install!","positive"
"Great sound. Versatility is lacking.","Sound quality is very good, with the subwoofer rounding out the bottom in a way smaller speakers cannot. I placed an order before the release date. At that time, there was no mention that when used as a stereo pair, bluetooth and line out capability would not be possible. About all you can use this system for is music through the Alexa app. This is okay for people who don't want to listen to a specific album, but if you do it can be frustrating. You will need to be on the website to see the exact name, and then request it by voice. Often Alexa gets it right, but sometimes not.  Connecting was not too hard, but follow the instructions. My subwoofer lost connection once so far, but after unplugging and replugging, has worked well. The richness and fullness that the subwoofer adds, along with the stereo sound of the two Echo Plus speakers makes for a very satisfying music experience. However, I am a little disappointed at the lack of versatility. I am hoping that a fix can be found.  I tried the calling feature, and it worked pretty well. However, the Alexa app on my phone seemed to drain the battery, and the phone was alarmingly hot to the touch. In Applications Manager, my phone showed that Alexa had used 13% of the battery since last charge. Within 2 to 3 hours of charging, my phone would be down to 40 to 50%. I uninstalled the app, and my phone seems to work the way it used to. I may trying reinstalling before I give up on it.  All in all, I am enjoying the system, though there are shortcomings. Once you have the music you want to listen to, you will probably be surprised at how good it sounds. I have listened to many hours of different types of music, and find the sound to be quite satisfying.","positive"

"She runs a tempertauture.  ?Local hub finction?","I purchased Alexa Plus (gen 1) the day it came out and now this (gen 2) Plus Hub.  I'll not rehash that experience so Amazon will not call me again.  OK if you don't have one of these Hubs they are cool and I like over Wink, GE and Hue.  Hue hub I gave away but still use Wink for Zwave and Stanley locks.  I run all the switches and WiFi off Alexa/Echo hub.  Now I have Alexa both gen 1 and 2 hubs running.  Good news this one just sync's-up and no issues so far.  So why did I purchase this well for temperature sensor and most important stand alone automation when WEB is down. Temperature works great if you wish to know as she runs 1.5 to 5 degrees hotter then the room when in use especially if you are enjoying the my opinion improves sound quality. So great if you want to take her temp but a word of caution if you are running heating/cooling automation off her reading alone.  As for standalone light controller when internet is out also, guess that is some enhancement as I couldn't get it to work just got the typical RED ring.  Why 4 stars, 1 because it is cool, 2 because it works kind-of, 3 because I purchased it after know what gen 1 was like out of the box and 4 so Amazon won't call asking me about my review.  Really is a fun great product nice new Android App update is what I use as the main driver for home automation after giving up circa 1978 X10/BSR system till a few years ago. Why not 5 stars?  I'll save that for when the product reaches the hype. I purchased not for what it can't do now but what it can do in the future. Except for new looks I have experienced nothing to praise over the older hub so far.","negative"

"Not even close....","I paired this with the new Sub and if you turn it up all the way its not as much Bass as you would think and the echos distort. Returned all 3 after 4hrs of setting up. I wanted to pair this with my TV but only 1 echo and the sub not all 3 would work. You would be better off getting a cheap echo and a nice soundbar with a sub which is what i look to do now.","negative"
"Really cool","I have had the echo dots in every room of the house. My son wanted to get this for the kitchen. The sound is awesome! I’m very happy with it. Actually, (no idea why) I didn’t even have to set it up. I turned it on and opened my Alexa app and it automatically added itself. The damnedest thing. Anyhoo, really cool. Linked up with all my other items except the Fire TV. That thing won’t link with anything. 😡","neutral"

"Horribly, horribly glitchy.","Saying the device I received was buggy is an understatement. Within a few minutes, it stopped being able to respond to requests. “Sorry, something went wrong.” What went wrong? No indication from the device or in the app. “Sorry I didn’t get that.” I’m two feet in front of it, and it can’t understand yes, no, or stop. Had to unplug it to stop music playback. It seems like after a minute or two of use, it just falls apart. Meanwhile my other Echo Dots have been without any issues since day one. Looking at other comments, I’m guessing I got a dud - really disappointing considering the price.","negative"

"Does Not Play “My Briefings” in “Everywhere” Mode","I’m only writing this in hopes that Amazon reads this and makes this change/update to the Amazon Echo Plus. I really love the “Start My Day” feature but I play it in the morning when I’m getting ready and doing my morning routine around my house. I bought 3 echo dots so that I could listen to “Start My Day” throughout the house in multiple rooms while showering, eating breakfast, getting dressed, etc. Except, you cannot play “Start My Day” in “everywhere” mode like you can music. Meaning, I can play music simultaneously on every Echo in my home but I cannot play “Start My Day” simultaneously on every Echo in my home. This is a really bigger downer for me that makes my Echo’s less valuable to me. I wish amazon would fix this and make an update available because it’s an easy fix seeing as Echo is already capable of playing music in “everywhere” mode. I hope amazon reads it’s customer reviews and makes this change.","negative"

"Audio is way too bass heavy","Audio is way too bass heavy and muddled for news radio. Even with bass turned completely off in EQ app, it is terrible for spoken word content. I’m an experienced pro audio guy and this is just not good. Also, the volume of Alexa voice response should be capable of being set independently of the program volume. It’s early morning and I’m speaking very quietly to the echo device but its responses are blasting (even with the volume set low). But good while others are sleeping. Perhaps there is a way to do this but not obvious to me yet. I also miss the manual volume control ring in the original Echo device. It works better than the + and - controls. On a positive note, it is pretty sensitive to voice commands.","negative"
"Get a different set up.  Save your money.","I've drank the Kool-Aid, I have an echo device in almost every room of my house and I have home automation controlled by Alexa throughout.  I was excited to see this echo sub, even more so when they released a bundle with the Echo Pluses...but this note was not in the original description, Sub only supports music playback over your wireless network, and does not support Bluetooth, 3.5mm AUX in, or TV/video.I don't know how any reviewers can be so thrilled with such limited options.  Mark completely missed for me, so disappointed because I wanted to love this bundle.  Returned.","negative"
"Speakers sound great but have crap functionality.","Extremely disappointed in the Amazon echo. I jumped on the bandwagon thinking it would be a good service. I am an avid music player and even have a fire TV. The Echo 2nd Gen with Sub touts 2.1 speaker setup which is incredibly misleading----let me explain. You cannot setup the speakers with fire TV without a substantial workaround. I was even advised by Amazon support to not try. Additionally you cannot play music to the echo devices via Bluetooth---you HAVE to play it via Alexa. The Alexa app is limited as well in functionality for musical purposes... You must use voice commands for searches and cannot play manually via a search entry by typing in. Sometimes Alexa malfunctions and says she cannot find a song even though she has played the song before which can be really frustrating. If all you do is listen to certain stations this might be a good option for you but if you want to customize a playlist on the go, I strongly advise to go with a different setup. This has been incredibly furstrating. If Amazon updates and improves the service I will be sure to update this. As it stands for anyone interested in the device for music purposes, I suggest using Sonos or any other devices that allow wifi or Bluetooth play functionality. I got the subwoofer thinking it would be great to improve sound quality---WHICH IT DOES AND IT SOUNDS GREAT!!----BUT unfortunately I can’t play to it via Bluetooth or WiFi... so for a song that isn’t found on amazon or the search function you cannot play it across a group of devices. This has been very frustrating. I would return all three devices I purchased but I already threw away the boxes and I am not the kind of person who habitual returns items to stores unless I am extremely dissatisfied—-which I am. I do not recommend this to anyone, except maybe one device for the kitchen.","negative"
"Happy with 2.1 system","This is my first set of WiFi speakers so I don’t have much to compare with, but I’m really liking these. I have the 2.1 system and it sounds great. Don’t really care much about smart control of the house so can’t rate it for that. Setup was a bit of a pain.","neutral"

"It is an improvement.  Looking mostly for sound quality.","Loved the Echo (2nd generation) sound considering its size.  My sound requirements are for good music in my home office.  Tried to update the Echo Dot with add an add-on speaker.  Got sick and tired of getting highly rated speakers only to be disappointed with the sound quality.  Decided to get the Echo Plus (second gen) after studying the new product.  Very, very happy with the product.  Sound is better than the Echo (not a massive difference, but, a very nice improvement).  The built-in smart hub is a bonus.","positive"
"That Alexa can doFascinating","Seems terrific but it will take me time to learn That Alexa can do","neutral"
"I don't know much yet, but what I have tried, I like very much!!","I primarily bought this because I wanted to enter the world of smart devices.  I bought some google home minis, but found you had to download apps from outsiders in order to use the smart light I wanted.  I looked at the privileges that were being demanded by the app and decided an app to control lighting had no reason to know who I called, when I called, or anything else about me personally.  Amazon already knows me (my husband thinks they pretty much own me) so I was more in favor of using the echo plus since it has a built-in hub and no third party app or skill was desired for the smart light I bought (actually, I received a free smart light bulb when I purchased the echo plus).I had a bit of trouble getting the light to work - Alexa didn't find it at first but I reset the bulb and then I was good to go.  I agree with others that the Alexa app interface is not really intuitive, but now that I have the light up and running, I am in love.  My 94-year old father is not very mobile and when he comes to stay with us, I wanted him to be able to turn the light on and off while he is still in bed.  This feature now works like a champ so I am very happy.I have played some prime music and that works well, but I still have a lot to learn about all the echo's features.The only reason I would not give it 5 stars right now is the alexa app - but that is really a separate issue, so I gave it 5 stars.","positive"

"Not what I expected","This is my 3rd time buying a Alexia device.  I enjoyed my original Echo and even the Echo plus.  I was hoping to use this 2.1 system instead of a sound bar for my TV. When paired with Apple TV or my Vizio Tv all is get is sound from one Echo plus not the entire 2.1 system. Maybe future updates will solve this, music sounds great.","negative"

I was pumped to watch movies with this setup pumping in the background------- BUT -------- it won't do that!  After checking into this, I realized that it wasn't setup for this.  HUGE FAIL imo and they need to get this fixed ASAP.  Why get a 2.1 surround sound if it only plays Amazon Music?When they fix this issue I will up my star rating.","negative"
"What's up with the mic!","I have my Echo set on a mantle about 10ft away from where my couch is in my living room and it seems to have problems hearing me correctly. There is also nothing around it at all and it still seems to be unable to hear me at all or just not understand me correctly.","negative"

"I don't consider this new Echo Plus an step up from the previous gen","I preferred the more clean look of the previous Echo Plus. That cloth, is an invitation for any cat at home (if you have feline companions like me) to put their claws on. The extra 0.5 inch on the woofer doesn't necessarily adds more quality to the sound. The tweeter is the same size on both models (0.8 inch). The built in temperature sensor is only useful is you ask Alexa for the temperature, I haven't found yet a way to monitor the temperature and get a notification if goes above a certain limit (useful, for example, to know if your AC goes down and you are not at home), I liked more the volume ring on the old model... looks like Amazon tried to simplify the product in order to cut costs and maximize profit. Those up and down volume buttons on the new model feels cheap. I bought this product on the 2 Echo Plus + Subwoofer combo. Once piece of advice: DONT'. that subwoofer only works for music coming from streaming. Doesn't work at all with any Bluetooth source of even the line in input. Given the silence from Amazon, looks like there is no way to fix this (probably will fixed in a new version of the product). In resume, if you want a product that sounds minimally better, with a very limited temperature sensor, you don't have problems with the cloth, and still want to pay a premium, go for it. Otherwise the previous version is still a best buy.","negative"
"Nightmare to connect.","When it's connected and up and functioning, it's a good product and I like it a lot.  The problem comes when the internet is lost, even for a short time.While my echo dot automatically reconnects when the internet is restored, the plus will not.  I am forced to constantly reset it and reboot the modem until it finally reconnects.  Sometimes this process takes hours because I have to repeat the connection process over and over until it finally decides to connect.Perhaps my echo plus is defective.  If so, I have no problem getting a replacement, but I need to be certain it is truly defective and not a quirk of the plus.5 stars when it's connected and functioning.  1 star because it won't automatically reconnect like my echo dot does and it's a nightmare to manually reconnect.As is usually the case, amazon tech support is non-existent.UPDATE:  I was actually contacted by someone from Amazon Tech Support.  They sent me a replacement Echo Plus that remedied this connectivity problem when the internet is lost for a while.  However, this replacement Echo Plus will not recognize any of my lights, even the bulb that came with the device.  I've tried everything from rediscovery to the paper clip reset then doing a discovery.  The old Echo Plus discovers and operates the lights perfectly.Interestingly, the new Echo Plus will operates the lights but only if the old Echo Plus is also plugged in (in a different room).  Pull the plug on the old Echo and the new Echo suddenly doesn't recognize any of the lights.  I'm at a loss as what to do now.  I've got to send one of these Echo's back soon or I'll be charged for it.Tiresome.","negative"

"No Bluetooth Stream","Bought the combo deal, two echos and subwoofer.It was a Nightmare to have them connected as stereo output. Had to delete and reassign them a couple of times for it to work.Sound quality is ok on the echosWhat you expect from them. The subwoofer really does make a difference to your music.Now here is my real issue. It only allows you to play stereo music through amazon music app or if you tell alexa. Which is unnaceptable because their apo is garbage and laggy. Sometimes it plays stereo and sometimes it only plays it through one echo and no subwoofer.Cant stream from another source or just connect your phone to the stereo source which I hope they fix in an uodate.","negative"

"Looks great and sounds fantastic!","I have been a fan and have owned every echo (except the first gen echo plus) from the beginning.  To me this is the echo to buy. First of all, it looks great.  The design team really improved on the looks and feel of this echo, even down to the white power cord. I know this sounds ridiculous to some, but it really does matter from a design perspective. Second,  I really love the sound on this echo. I can finally hear some bass! To my ears it sounds rich and full.  I enjoyed the sound on the original echo, but wasn't convinced on the second generation echo, (eventhough it did sound much better after a software update), after spending a full day listening to various music on the 2nd gen echo plus (my wife loves film scores and I like indie) we fell in love with the speaker and actually had fun listening to the music. Amazon Music plays great with this speaker and they have really great curated playlists.  One more point on the music, the echo plus 2nd gen paired perfectly and seemlessly into the home group...echo show in the kitchen, first gen echo in sons room and a spot in master bedroom, We liked this speaker so much we purchased the new echo dot to replace the dot in my daughters room and wow, what a difference. I am not an audophile but to me this speaker is enjoyable to listen to and sounded fantastic throughout our home.  As far as the smart control for our home, this paired instantly! I didnt have to add my wi fi password (I am sure this is because I already have my account linked), Just plugged in and away we went!  Which was nice.  I have smart lights (sengled), Harmony hub, Nest thermostat, all worked and connected without me doing anything.  I think I was supposed to recieve a phillips hue bulb with this, it was advertised at Best Buy, but I was there right when they opened on the first day of availability, and they werent even on the shelf yet... it got lost in the excitement and I forgot to ask lol.  Anyway, I was hoping to try out the built in hub, but like I said my sengled hub connected without any problems.  The sensor built in the echo works really good and saved me $40 from having to buy a sensor for the downstairs with my Nest thermostat (another reason the $150 price tag is a good value).  You are able to create routines based on the temperature from the sensor, which is a nice touch.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.  I think the alexa team has really stepped up thier game and it shows.  If this is a first time smart speaker purchase for someone, I wouldnt hesitate. Built in Hub for lights, sensor built in, makes this worthy of the price tag and if you are just beginning in the smart home arena, you will be glad you went with this. (I had to learn as I went and ended up spending more money than I probabably needed too).  I also think this is a worthy upgrade for existing echo owners.  I ended up selling my 2nd gen echo to a friend but kept my first gen echo (I still love the volume ring!)  Great Job Amazon Alexa team! (There has to be a name for this group!?","positive"
"Good Quality Earphones for Budget Price!","PROS:• Sound quality is surprisingly good (not great obviously) for budget price (although I'm not an audiologist), and has a lot more bass than the Lightsky Wireless Bluetooth Earphones previously purchased for over half the price• Previous song (- volume button) and Next song (+ volume button) ability, unlike the Lightsky previously purchased, which only had the ability to skip to the next song• Call quality is clear with no issues listening and talking to people on the other line• Good battery life during high-volume music playback (see test below)• Earphones stayed in and did not fall out of ears during gym workout and cardio• Case provided to store earphones and micro-to-usb charging cable• Pairing is quick and phone recognizes earphones right away once powered on• Audio does not intermittently cut out when phone is in pocket like other reviewers have experienced• Audibly informs you when powered on, powered off, and low battery• Earphones does noise cancellation well if volume is high enough and music has a lot of bass• Bluetooth connection stays solid and connected unless out of certain range, unlike other reviewers who have experienced the opposite• Range is pretty good, about 50-60 ft as long as there is a clear path opening, although minor obstacles like gym equipments is ok (from my experience)CONS:• Not ideal for people with small ears, even with the additional 3 variety sizes of earbuds• Ear hooks are not adjustable and I found myself occasionally having to re-adjust the hooks so the earbuds stay tightly in ears during gym workouts• Playback hours fell on the lower end of the 7-9 hours range (as mentioned in test below) on medium volume, and even worse on high volume• Rubber USB charging port cover is flimsy and weak, and prone to being torn completely if not careful• Battery died even though phone shows earphones had 30% battery life left, which is a bit deceiving• USB charging cable too short, about 10 at most• Earphones are a bit bulky and do stick outUSEFUL INFO:• Ran 1 battery test at full volume on iPhone 7, playing a 3 hr song, with phone right next to earbuds, and it lasted about 5 hrs 45 minutes before it disconnected from the phone• Ran 1 battery test at medium volume on iPhone 7, playing a 3 hr song with phone right next to earbuds, and it lasted about 7 hrs 22 minutes before it disconnected from the phone• Took about 1 hr 44 minutes to fully charge from dead using a 5V power source","positive"

"Excellent headphones at an excellent price","I've had these for just over a week and I am very pleased with them.  I needed to have over-the-ear headphones because those little in-the-ear wings that most headphones have just will not stay put.  I'm happy to report that these stay put in a variety of situations.  I've done both resistance workouts and cardio workouts with them and they barely moved.  I would recommend using the standard ear plugs instead of the memory foam, however, if you sweat a lot.  With a lot of sweat and/or vigorous movement they won't stay super locked in the ear canal, but I don't mind that- they don't pop out or fall off either.While sitting at my desk or going out for a walk, I use the memory foam plugs and they work great.  They cancel 80-90% of the ambient noise and (most importantly) wind.  I just got back from a walk on a very windy day and although I could still hear the wind, it was more like it was in the background- it didn't affect the sound at all.  The memory foam plugs also really enhance the sound quality.I'm not an audiophile so I can't really speak to sound quality, but to me they sound great.  Just as good as any other headphones I have ever had, and better than most.Overall I am very impressed with these, and you simply cannot beat the price.  They are comfortable, they stay put, and the sound quality is good. I don't know how long they will last, but even if they only last 6 months, I will still buy another pair.  I just wish they came in green.  :)","positive"

"Only lasted two months","Update: After the company who sold the product saw my review they decided to resend me a new set of headphones. I received an email from them and they said a replacement pair was sent to me. It is about four months from my post and I still haven’t found a pair I liked as much as these. I hope they last longer tha. The first because the price point and light weight feel are nice. If these last longer than the prior pair I will change the three stars I just revised again. I guess contacting a third party seller next time might be something I should do.These were fine until they stopped working completely two months after purchase. I bought them 1/28/18 and today they cut out. I thought it was they needed charged, but they are not charging, nor do I see the light. I used them for the treadmill 2-3 times a week since purchase and now they are not functioning. This is very disappointing because I have grown to enjoy no cord when running.","negative"
"Sub-premium headset for a budget price.","These headphones offer an amazing value for their price.  Their sound quality is very good for a budget bluetooth device, with sub-premium sound that easily rivals $15-20 wired equivalents.  The antenna itself is of decent quality, I didn't even notice that I had left my phone in the other room while I showered.  The waterproofing is also quite adequate, having survived an intentional run through the shower and an unintentional day trip in some of the heaviest rain you could imagine.  Attached is a photo of my shirt from that trip -- You can see I was quite soaked, even through my supposedly waterproof coat.Another really cool feature is that you can connect this to two different devices.  If you turn off bluetooth on the first device to avoid accidental connection, you can pop it back into pairing mode (by holding down the power button for five seconds while off) and then connecting to a second device.  When you reactivate the bluetooth and pair with the first device, it will maintain connection with BOTH devices.  It's pretty schwifty to have it connected to the media on your tablet while still being able to take calls on your phone.The only real cons are that the +/- buttons feel reversed, and that they seem to dislike being shaken.  While running violently or doing jumping jacks you may notice the occasional stagger, but honestly, as long as the phone is relatively close and unobstructed I doubt normal users would have any issue.  It managed to maintain a signal with my tablet through 3 plastic bags and a book bag with very little stutter except while booking it to catch a bus.Bottom line: if you're looking for a great pair of budget wireless earbuds that won't quit because of a little rain or interference these are certainly worth a try.  If you're looking for a product with more superb audio fidelity and super rich basses, you're better off buying a more expensive pair of wired headphones","neutral"

I charged them, used them for 10 minutes and then shut them off. The next morning I went to use them and they were dead! The music has static in the background and the calls are even worse. Either these are terrible and you get what you pay for, or my pair are defective. I am not happy about this I sent a review to the company but have not heard anything back from them. Extremely disappointed. I guess you get what you pay for. :(","negative"
"Not happy with the product, but pleasantly surprised with the producer!","Poor sound quality, poor fit, poor durability. I purchased this product for my wife for use at the gym. The most important quality for her was that it was waterproof as she spends quite a bit of time in the sauna after her workout. The earbuds only lasted a week before one of the two earpieces went dead. Furthermore the loops that go over the ear are not adjustable. Those with smaller ears will have a hard time keeping these things in place during a workout. Sound quality is just junk. The little wired earbuds that are normally packed in with new cell phones are much, much better. Bluetooth range on these is also poor. The only reason I gave this two stars is that it at least paired with the phone and worked.Update: 6/25/18The seller contacted me shortly after I left this review to inform me that they are sending me a replacement free of charge. Understand that I did not ask for a replacement or reach out to the vendor at all, they reached out to me (+1 star for unexpectedly good customer service)That being said, they sent me a light blue Mpow Cheeta rather than the Flame. As such my wife gave them to me and took my other bluetooth headphones.That being said (vendor giving these to me for free) Here's what I think of it:First of all the Mpow Cheeta sounds better. Decent bass, kinda warm mids, and highs are not lost. Works best with Pop, less so with Rock, and just serviceable with Hip-hop and EDM.Waterproofing is better. I've taken several showers with these after a workout and haven't had any failures.Bluetooth range and battery life is also improved on the Cheeta.Still has issues with fitment. This time the cord connecting the two earpieces is semi rigid and has a permanent curl to it. This has the effect of only allowing the user to route the cable behind one's head. Simply put the cable gets in the way when doing bar squats or bench work. The cable is also a bit too short and non-adjustable. I have a fairly large head (about a 7 5/8 hat size) and so the Cheetas barely fit me. An annoying issue, they often pull out of my ear if I rotate my head too far.The Cheetas may work for you if you have a normal or smaller head, listen to pop more than rock, and don't mind taking them off for bar squats or bench work.","negative"
"Best value, reliable and durable active wear headphones","Okay. I am not going to blow smoke up your ass and tell you this headset offers the BEST audio quality, because it's 20-25$.

Not wanting to waste money on an eventual and probable dog chew toy, not to mention how easy it is to lose headphones, I decided to try these. Its true- the bass is a bit overwhelming and I would rate the comfort as average compared to top brand name headsets. But the reason I rated it 5 stars is because for the price, you simply can't beat it. If your like me and you constantly lose headphones or break them, this is the best alternative to spending hundreds of dollars replacing brand name items. I have used them for over a month now for on average 4 hours or more a day and can say they have an EXCELLENT battery life. Connection is easy as well, which I cannot say for competitive products from stores like Walgreens (why I decided to buy headphones from Walgreens, I know. Not the best decision.) I run at least a mile every day and two miles at least twice a week, and have no issues with them falling out or frying because of my own sweat. They have been exposed to a small amount of water, in the form of light rain and steam in the shower- yes, I know, don't leave your electronics on the bathroom counter-revolutionary and work fine. The reason I was prompted to write this review is because I literally just stepped on one of the earpieces, not like a full on squash but a halfway step I realized immediately. I did not expect them to work but to my surprise they are completely fine! I decided immediately to write a five star review. Look. They are not the best sounding most comfortable headphones on the market- the cord, as you can see in my high quality proffesional image, is not reinforced in the middle or weighted to sit down around the back of your neck and kill flap about during a run. The bass can be obnoxious and drown out some higher tones. But I don't care! The value greatly outweighs the cost as they have proven to be reliable, and most importantly the BATTERY LIFE is on par with higher quality expensive products. I'd say they last around 5-6 hours on a full charge. Using them for phone calls works great, the sound quality is absolutely fine, and people can hear what I'm saying. Again, they are slightly bulky and oversized, and if you have weird ears the ear hooks might bother you- but If your looking for a low cost solution for active wear headphones I reccomend this product as they stay in your ears and seem to be somewhat indestructible. Eventually I will run them through the laundry, because that's just the kind of person I am, and I am curious as to how they will stand up to that terrifying ordeal, but I have faith that they can overcome the spin cycle of electronic death. Do not take people criticizing the sound quality seriously as you have to be reasonable with expectations regarding a sub 50$ product.","positive"
"Slightly better than you’d expect for $19","My $120.00 zipbuds died and I needed a replacement pair for runs. This pair is just about what you’d expect given the price, if not a tad better. While the sound of my zipbuds is 10 times better it’s not really fair to compare them given the price disparity. These headphones are relatively comfortable and have a good volume range. I also like that they come with a carrying case. The sound quality is serviceable but not great. They have decent bass but the treble and highs are muddy and not very clear. All in all they’re fine for a run but not good if you’re an audiophileUPDATE: The company mailed me their Cheetah headphones after seeing my review which sound way better than the flame ones they sent me, so I am upgrading my review to 5 stars based on the great customer service provided and superior product mailed to me. Highly recommend the company’s cheetah headphones which were $2 more and sound much better.","neutral"
"Did not work with my phone, but good customer service.","I bought this item because of all of the good reviews. I did a lot of research before purchasing it. I don't use the headset that often, only when I'm around other people. Went on vacation to find that no one in our party including my techy teenage son could get the same to work. I went to return it on Amazon to find that it was one day after the return date had expired. I'm assuming that I got a defective pair, but unfortunately the manufacturer's return window was so small that I'm out of luck. Sad waste of money.Update: customer service so my review and sent me a new pair. That was very kind of them, but unfortunately that pair did not work with my phone either. It seems to be a problem with the BLU R1+ running Android version 6. 0. I still don't have a working pair of headphones, a customer service did all that they could.","neutral"
"easy instructions, simple connect","None of the 3 stars are for sound quality. Gave 3 stars for: Well made, well packaged, easy instructions, simple connect, carrying case, plethora of extra buds, fits comfortable (very secure and sturdy). Loved the way the feel and I could tell that they would be great for working out with the flat cord. However, the sound was of poor quality. Low highs, unstable/distorted bass even at low levels, mids are too pronounced. I listen to everything: Country, rap, R&B, pop, Classic, Classic Rock, Reggae, Alternative, etc (ie. eclectic). I guess I could have adjusted the eq in my phone, but the price is too close to better sounding Bluetooth Headphones that are awesome straight out the box (I ordered: Ankers Soundcore Spirit and a pair of Dudios if you are curious and still looking. Great price and one has the same platform.)Gave them to a friend, he was amazed I would give him such great looking headphones for free! However; I haven't seen him wear them once. I've seen where he took them out, but I've never seen him wear them. I'm guessing it's because of the poor sound quality. Great Platform, poor sound, which is key for me. Price is great, but for an extra $10 that I would easily waste on a meal, I can get a better sounding device out the box.","positive"
"Very good value for the money","I've had a bunch of headsets I use for running, mowing the lawn and all sorts of less sweat intensive activities.  This one is pretty good.  First, it's loud.  All others I've run with on full volume, and mostly they would get drowned out by passing traffic.  Some songs have really loud recording levels but old cds that I've turned into MP3s often have a soft recording level.  Mowing the lawn with the old ones was nearly useless.  This one is great!  In most cases, running I don't have the volume all the way up.  Mowing the lawn, I do.My two criticisms are: 1.  the strap connecting the left and right speaker looks dumb if I put it under my chin and sticks to my sweaty neck while running and checking both ways before crossing the street.  Since it has the things going over my ears, they stay in place, but turning your head will partially pull the speaker out of your ear; and 2.  Not many will care about this, but if you run in cold weather, the speakers are so big, it will be very hard to keep your ears warm.  The coldest I've run in 2018 is - 8 F.  At that temp I leave the headset at home, because, I can't keep my ears warm.Overall, I don't think you can beat the sound for the price and it works well for most activities I do.","positive"
"Even My Dog Couldn't Break these!","Alright, these are literally the most durable headphones I have ever seen.Literally last night, I used these, and this morning I pulled it out of my ears.  Well!!! My mini schnauzer decided to grab ahold of them and chew it up to wake me up.  (Apparently he had to pee). Anyway, he totally ripped off the top of the headphone, and actually chewed the plastic around it slightly.  I was so disappointed because I've only had these a little over a month and I LOVE them.  Well, as it turns out, the music quality is still PERFECT! I simply replaced the top part and now they're good as new! I can't feel a difference.  So if you're looking for headphones that even a DOG can't chew up, get this! 10/10.I kind of wish I could get a new one because the chew marks don't make it that asthetically pleasing, but hey! Music is what matters. I use them every single night to listen to Michael Sealey hypnosis sessions, because I didn't want to use by big, bulky, wooden ones with a small chiropractic pillow.And the result?! They're amazing! They're the best headphones I've ever seen.  I was actually able to run 2 miles with these still in and my ears sweat like crazy! It did fall out around the 2.5 mile marker but that's amazing for a headphone considering how much I sweat!","positive"
"Mic does not work","The good:1. Music quality is great for a $20 headphone2. Long, reliable battery lifeThe mediocre:1. Pairing is often difficult.  I've had to remove and repair a couple of times but it seems to work alright now; however, I rarely use because of the badThe bad:2. Phone call mic sounds is awful.  I've never had a successful phone call because others on the line complain that there's a loud interference-type noise.  It could be interference, but I didn't have this problem with my favorite Axgio earbuds (no longer in production).  For this reason, only 2 stars because the headphones are rendered useless for me without the ability to talk on conference calls","negative"
"Highly Recommend for people with Small Ears and or Ear Canals!!","Great headphones for those who have small ears/ear canals! I have had the hardest time finding earbuds that would stay in my ears at all especially when working out and I need my music to work out! I have tried several stating they had different sizes and would fit small ears, but they would still fall out at the smallest tilt of my head. I have been searching and reading reviews for awhile and decided to give these a shot...and what do you know they actually stayed in my ears for an entire 90 min workout!! I did have to do some adjusting a few times, but they stayed in my ears and I have not found any earbuds that would prior! I sweat too much to use the over the ears kind and really felt dumb wearing those anyways. I gotta give these 5 stars for just the fact they weren't making me crazy constantly trying to keep them from falling, but they aren't bad in sound quality either. Probably a little heavy on the bass output, but they are a great buy especially for the price!","positive"
"Great headphones, not sweatproof at all, bad quality control","I needed a pair of headphones to connect to my Ionic that I could go jogging with. These things worked great with the Ionic, you can control the volume on the watch or the headphones, they hold on to your ear well. Biggest problem was that they would cut in and out after running/sweating for 10 minutes. These are definitely not IPX7 rated. They didn't even last me a week. It's likely a quality control issue based on the reviews I read here. There are other reviewers who have had the same problem, and others who have not. The worst part was that I contacted MPOW customer support and asked for a replacement, and rather than replacing them they said - This headset is sweat-proof. If the sweat goes into the headset and makes it malfunction, please dry the sweat with air dryer to try again..... Pretty contradictory. I returned through amazon and purchased another set through another company/brand.","positive"
"Excellent Headset for the Price","I had a pair of a different model of Mpow Bluetooth headphones that worked well--until I had them on while getting a haircut. The left earpiece stopped working after the haircut; I can only guess that the wire must have been internally damaged by the barber.  That was my mistake; I should have taken them off before sitting down in the barber chair.  (Oops!)  So I looked for a replacement headset.  These Mpow Flame ear buds seemed worth a try for only about 22 bucks.  I ordered them and they arrived timely and in perfect condition.  It took less than 2 hours to charge them up and they were ready.  I found it a bit tricky to learn how to use the controls, but they're not bad once you get the hang of it.  The instruction manual is mostly cryptic pictograms, with very little English.  Very frustrating and virtually impossible to understand. Might as well use the instruction booklet as a coaster under your Coke bottle! Luckily, I managed to figure out the operation of the headset by myself.  It took a couple of tries to get it to pair with my phone, but once that was done, it has been easy to use since.  The fit in my ears is okay, but the hard plastic tends to make my ears sore after a couple of hours of listening.  I wish it were made of a more cushiony material.  The range is good, but not great when you go into another room.  You may experience minor cut-outs.  It may be okay for music, but it can be frustrating if you are listening to an educational lecture and are hanging on every word.  This is a minor inconvenience, but I did not find it a deal killer.  The controls are all mounted on the right earpiece. This is both good and bad. The good: the controls are convenient and easy to find.  The bad: I found it entirely too easy to accidentally push one of the buttons, as there is very little surface by which to adjust the earphone in your ear. (There are no controls on the left earpiece, so the left side does not have the same problem.) I have not determined whether the ear hooks really do much to keep the headphones in place, or whether you'd be just as well off without them.  Time will tell.  I also have not used the headset to make calls yet, so I can't comment on the call quality. (The other Mpow headset I had worked fine for calls, however.)  The sound quality for this headset is pretty good, if not audiophile quality.  (For that, you might want to try some of the famous brand names--but of course those will cost $100 and up.  You pay for what you get!)  One caveat--the bass is a little lacking, but improves significantly when you press gently on the earpieces to form a better seal with your ear canals.  Perhaps experimenting with the different size ear cushions (included) will improve the bass somewhat.  Finally, there are no magnets in the earpieces to hold them to each other when they are hanging loosely around your neck.  This would be helpful in keeping the headset from falling off when not in use.  The bottom line: These are pretty nice headphones for the money, and, despite a few nit-picks, are well worth the money.  If Mpow incorporates improvements based on the information in this and other reviews (even if the price has to be raised a bit to cover the cost of the improvements), the next generation could be an awesome value indeed.EDIT:  I tried the largest ear cushions and it made a significant improvement in the bass.  (Also included is a pair of memory foam ear cushions.  I have not tried those yet.)  Another note:  The wire is a little short for when you are using only one of the earphones, and it tends to tug on your ear when you turn your head.  This can be annoying.  If Mpow made the wire 6 (15 cm) longer it would be great.","positive"
"Poor audio quality, comfort, and isolation.","I'm now being offered money to delete this review.So just FYI, this is also a shady company. Don't give them your money.Poor audio quality, everything sounds very muddy. There's zero crispness to the audio. They're pretty uncomfortable to wear as well. The BT antenna isn't too bad, but my phone being in my left pocket and the antenna being in the right ear can sometimes cause dropouts if either contact skin. The isolation both from outside noise and from your audio out is very poor overall.For the price, I guess it is okay, but you can do better. Anker's SoundBuds Curve offer better audio quality, comfort and isolation. But suffers from a similarly weak BT Antenna.I'm not changing my review, stop emailing me. These headphones are garbage.I'm now being offered money to delete this review.So just FYI, this is also a shady company. Don't give them your money.","negative"
"Stay put in ears, decent sound, light weight, good sound quality","I've only used these twice, once around the house and once for a workout. I can't comment on the battery life yet, but overall I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable they are and how they stay put in my ears. They stay put really well even while jogging, and I love that there's no cord flopping around or extraneous noise from said cord--you know, because they are CORDLESS! The quality case and extra ear bud tips with bonus foam tips are a nice touch. Right now I'm happy w/the rubber/silicone tips, but may give the foam ones a try. The headphones  seem pretty sturdy and are light enough that you don't really feel them while you're running or moving around. My only complaints are:1. The ear hooks are too long and don't sit on my ears, they just stick up in a useless way--it would be nice if they were adjustable. I am a petite female, so maybe they would fit better on an average sized human. I will say they don't interfere in any way with my glasses.2. The neck strap is kinked and stiff and a bit annoying, but I'll try the clip that comes with it to shorten it. You could easily just cut the neck strap off, but I think it's a good, handy feature if you ever want to take the ear buds out to talk to someone or just take a break and hang them around your neck.3. I wish there was some indication of battery life left. It's a guessing game. They do charge pretty fast--in about an hour using a USB port on my laptop.Overall, highly recommend--nice product at a very good price, and easily paired with my iPod Nano 7th gen) and iPhone SE. I should add I mostly listen to podcasts while I work out, so sound quality is not a huge issue for me, but I do think the sound quality is quite good.  Give them a try--for around $20 you can't go wrong.","positive"
"STOPPED WORKING- company replaced","I loved these, a lot. Until they stopped working today. They were charging overnight. I tried to use them for my run this morning and they will not turn on. The light is not on while charging. It is past my return period by 2 weeks of course. I have only used them for a month and a half. They should have a much longer life.Edited to update- The company sent me a replacement pair. I appreciate their promptness in replacing them. I hope these ones work for longer, because when they work, they are great!","negative"
"Great bargin, horrible battery life. - Update: Company sent replacement, improved battery.","You get what you pay for and for the price this is a great deal. Headset sounds great while using the memory foam ear bud pads. One major downfall is the battery life....and as a frequent podcast and music listener hearing  low battery in my head every 20 seconds is a dumb feature. There's already an indicator on my phone for Bluetooth device power. Why that recording was added to playback is silly. The most I get is 4hrs on full charge. Which may be enough for most. Not for me. In had a pair of beats 3 and loved them... But the poor build quality won't bring me back to buy another pair.These will do till I find something better.---Update: the company has amazing customer service. Without my concern or demand, they sent out a replacement pair of earbuds and I have to report, after a week or two, the battery life is significantly improved. the firmware needs work. i don't feel the vocal instructions do much other than to annoy and take up unnecessary time. lines like the device is connected, device is powered off, etc... it adds nothing. With my Android phone, I get those notifications just fine. These headphones really don't need a low fidelity scratchy recording telling you what your own actions, and connected devices already display. i know it's on, and i know it's connected.Otherwise, good price, good headset.","negative"
"Nice headphones for teeny ears","Trying to workout with a cord attached to your phone is not an enjoyable experience. I needed a Bluetooth headset, and was NOT going to pay over $150 for a fancy name brand.  It's not like I'm auditioning musicians on the treadmill and need studio quality sound. These are pretty decent - once I figured out how to get them to stay on.  I have teeny ears with teeny ear canals for a grown woman.  I can only use the very smallest silicone caps that come with this set, and I have to put the bale over my ear and then slide it back so that it really hooks behind my ear.  It sometimes wants to slip out if I get icky sweaty, and today I noticed that if I walk swiftly through the gym, there is a bit of wind noise, but that could be because of my teeny ear canals.  I find the cord that goes behind the head to be a little stiff, I hope it gets softer with time so it does not bonk out as it does now.  The sound is very good - though I do wish it had a decibel throttle on it.  I turned my phone on one time and nearly blew my head clean off it was so unbelievably loud.  It should never ever start out that loud, I find that to be dangerous.  Overall, good headset for the price.  It comes with a nice round zipper case.  I make sure to wipe off the entire set with one of the disinfecting cloths at the gym at the end of a workout so they stay clean and ready for the next day.","positive"
"Wouldn't stay put in my ears as I ran","I really wanted to like these as the sound was great and it was so nice not having a cord attached to my phone as I ran.  Sadly, they just would not stay in my ears when I ran.  There are 2. reasons why.  1. Having the controls on the actual ear pieces themselves makes them too heavy to stay still.  It's easier to work the controls from my phone anyway so for me, this is not a necessary feature.  2. The pieces that wrap around your ears are not shapeable.  I had an old pair (not bluetooth) where the around the ear pieces were made of a gumby like material so they could securely shape to your ear which really helped the buds stay put and not move at all.  I tried all 3 sizes of buds and was able to get one ear to not fall out, but sadly I couldn't get the other ear to stay put and I was constantly adjusting them when I ran.  I also found that the piece in the back would stick to my neck or shirt as I got sweaty and pull to one side, further making the buds move around, and the piece to secure the strap together popped off during my first run and is now lost forever.  Sadly I returned these.Will look for a brand that doesn't have the controls on the ears.","negative"
"Edit.  Didnt last long","Edit. Got these April and they have alrrady stopped working. I guess something had to give when you get good sound and a cheap price---These are really good headphones especially if you have an up-to-date phone. They are already loud and pretty clear but Smartthings automatically adjust it to your music based on your preferences. The wire-clamp is useless but luckily the wire isn't overly long like some other bluetooth headphones i have had. Changing to the smaller tips they fit perfectly in my ear and there isn't that constant cutting out when i jog. Battery also last pretty long on a charge.I do find it weird that the button in the front when these are on your ears is the button to go to the previous track and the button behind is to go forward, weird choice.If you don't adjust your settings for the buds they will sound very basic i tested them on two phones all week both up-to-date cells and noticed a huge difference. Also be careful with bluetooth 4.0 disconnect from devices you don't want to use if you don't want them switching between devices.In the end anything i was not satisfied with these are completely outweighed by the fact at how inexpensive they are.","negative"
"Stops Charging","I've had this headset for a little more than a month. in the beginning it worked great. i previously owned the BOSE sport headset so i was really impressed with the quality and audio. I charged it yesterday before going to the gym but after a few mins of using it i heard the battery low warning. i though i didnt charge it correctly. but today i had the headset charging like i usually do while i settle in at work, it was charging for a full hour but i am still hearing the low battery warning. i was really hopeful with this headset.UPDATE: the company sent me a brand new headset right away. Works great now, with no complaints. I’m so happy they exchanged it without any issues and that I can listen to my music without having to get tangled up in a cord","negative"
"Absolutely increadible!!!!","These headphones are a steal. For the last 7 years of my life I’ve been using Bose headphones, Day in day out I’ve always been a brand snob. But I got these becaus I wanted some wireless headphones to play Baskettball with that wouldn’t have the long wires. Wow did i hit the jackpot with these. The battery life is an easy 7 hours, and that’s not like a leave it on and it’ll die in 7 hours that’s play loud music for 7 hours. Also the range on the Bluetooth is increadible, I’ve forgotten my phone in a room at school and not realized it until I stepped out of the room and was halfway down the hall, at least 100 yards through a wall. I regularly leave my phone on the side of a baskettball court and can run the whole court without ever having any sort of connectivity issues at all. The sound quality is what really blew me away though. These really are right on par with the Bose headphones. Now the ones I have are 2 years old and a no longer made model. But these still go toe to toe with a brand that costs at least 4x as much. They really are the best value headphones I’ve had in a long time. If you have been looking for a good pair of headphones but don’t want to get screwed on price go for these. You won’t regret the purchase!","positive"
"Excellent Customer Service and Headphones!","UPDATED 7/24/2018After posting my review MPOW reached out to me and sent me a brand new pair, even though I had already had my previous headphones for a few months! I can not be happier with how MPOW took it upon their selves to replace mine at no cost to me. It's amazing to see this level of customer service at the price point of the MPOW Flame Headphones! Keep up the good work MPOW, you have a new loyal customer, and thank you!Original PostThese where great why they lasted but after using these almost daily for the last few months they just stopped charging. I've been charging these from my laptop USB port since I bought them and haven't had any issue previously but one day they just stopped charging, the LED that used to turn red when charging then blue when finished no longer turns on when plugged in and the Mpow Flame Bluetooth headphones will not power on. I've tried a bunch of different charges and get the same results, they will not charge.","positive"
"Build Quality and Sound Great. Comfort and Features Not Good","The good: Good build quality, good sound, good battery life and quick enough charge time.The bad: This may be subjective but these aren’t comfortable. They’re not earbuds really because there’s so much built outside of the earbud itself. And to get the earbud comfortably firm in my ear I have to press this in pretty hard and all of that external material presses hard against my ear.Also bad: the power button is the red (or whichever color you chose) metal on the side. It’s right where it would be best to press the earbud into my ear so several times trying to adjust the fitting, I’d press that button pausing my music.I also am not a fan of this and other brands sacrificing buttons by making the volume buttons also be track skip buttons. I’m always skipping tracks by accident when I just want to control volume. Make separate buttons for volume and tracks PLEASE!","negative"
"Happy Customers Now","My son really liked these headphones! They are comfortable and hang nicely around his neck when not using them. If I were to have reviewed them the week we purchased... 5 stars! Now alittle over a month later, they just stopped working. One minute he was talking with his friends playing an online game with everything fine, the next minute, nothing. Fully charged, tried re-paring them with the computer, checked to see if they worked with the phone, but nothing. For the price, they are worth it. I did order another pair, hoping that maybe we just had a faulty one-I’ll be sure to review that pair once they come.... after a month of use8/16/18 Update: Seller sent a replacement for the first pair ( I also ordered another set, now we have 2~which is good!) Both pairs have been working very well since we got them. We must have received a faulty pair the first time. I am glad I have a pair to use now too. Great customer service for replacing them without me requesting a replacement","positive"
"Great buds and I'm not talking about 420","For $20, this is by far the best earbuds I've ever had.  The bass is amazing and with extra ear buds, there's one for every size.  The fit and finish of the product is very good considering the price.  Charging is fast and battery life of 5 hours, could be longer but it's good enough.  Most importantly is that they hold to your ears very well and they are light weight.  I have issues with earbuds since they are always falling out and I have not had a problem with these.  Worked on my car for 4 hours and never once had I have to fix them from falling and it's light weight made it comfortable for long periods of use.  Easy to use and easy to connect and after my experience with Mpow customer service, I'm happy to say I love their products and what they stand for.  They're an affordable alternatives to all those over priced buy it for the name brand stuff that sounds equally as good.Would highly recommend these to anyone.","positive"
"Im not impressed or even satisfied","I am something of an audiophile and came from some VModa Crossfade M100 headphones to finding myself in need of some bluetooth ear buds. So maybe i'm a bit snobbish when it comes to sound. I am 49 years old and the days of needing to rock out are rather behind me and now I enjoy quality more than volume.I tried connecting these to my Galaxy Note 8 and to a FiiO X1. Right away in both I noticed the difference in sound quality from what I came from. For me these sound tinny and the quality is what I would expect from ear buds from a gas station. I gave them to my son who just needed something to listen to from the soundbar while I was sleeping. He seems to like them ok. But he got them for free so that probably helped. Honestly though. I am likely to buy him a pair of the 1Mii bluetooth headphones when I get paid. They are also cheap but the sound is noticeably better","negative"
"Easy to connect to media streaming and work great","These are great. When deliberating between the Amazon Fire Stick and Roku with the headset capable control, I decided that the Roku was a better option as I could use headphones for private listening - until I read a Roku review where the user was unhappy with the low battery life for the Roku controller. I knew the Fire Stick had Bluetooth capabilities but seemed not as convenient as a simple plug in headphone but decided to research the issue. First, find a set of Bluetooth headphones. There were cheaper sets - about half the price but reading the reviews decided to spend a little more for the Mpow Flame headphones. I don't know how the others work but these are great - with theTV/ FireStick on, just turn on the headphones and they are picked right away - just click on yes and you're on. I have used these for several hours before the low battery notification was verbalized and you simply plug in the charger and your good again.","positive"
"Dude... Bass!!!","The bass is so kickin' on these headphones. I am a bass head, so this is great for me. I can see why some say it's unbalanced, but I don't mind because I love bass so much. Love these headphones, so much bass for so little headphones. Best I've ever had.Went for a bike ride with them today. Can't say that wind noise was a problem, will have to pay more attention to that next time but given I can't remember any it must not have been bad.I have very small ear canals and the smallest earpieces aren't small enough; the earbuds want to come loose from within my ear and if they stay in then my ears begin to hurt after less than an hour. After reviewing the contents I found that there is a set of memory foam eartips. They seem larger but perhaps the memory foam will be more forgiving; I will try them next. If that doesn't work then I will have to shop for another pair of headphones.Still like them though, it's not their fault my ear canals are small.Good headphones.","positive"
"Great headphones","For the price they are great. Awesome sound.  Really holds well in my ear.  I like the zip up pouch it comes when with.  It was very easy to hook to my Bluetooth.  The only thing I’m not crazy about is the volume button and the next song button are one in the same.  When running it’s hard to hold that button for a longer period so that I can skip songs.","positive"
"$20?!","Yeah, so I picked these up for $20, not expecting much.I got MUCH!Setup is easy (I bought them to use with a laptop that has HORRIBLE speakers), they sound good, and they get pretty loud. They're pretty comfortable and have a good range. I can wander the 25 feet or so to get a beer from the fridge and they're still plugging away.There are two things that kind of bug me:  the *REALLY* short charge cable (it's just microUSB, but don't feed it any more than 5v) and the flat cable running between them. I'd have preferred a round cable as they're easier to curl up and stay how you want them to.Aside from that? Totally worth the $20. I'll comment back in the battery life if it's not good. Been going for about an hour from the out-of-the-box charge, so that's nabad.","neutral"
"I really wanted to like these...but that's not the case.","I've started running recently and was looking for a reliable pair of sweat proof bluetooth headphones.  These are the highest rated in a lower price range with the most reviews, so I figured it was a no brainer.  I've had issues with earbuds in the past but the ear hook, along with thousands of 5 star reviews, had me convinced these would stay in just fine.  The packaging it arrived in was attractive, and i was happy to see multiple sizes of earbuds to try out.  As a first test, I used them to cut the grass. They were plenty loud enough, but had absolutely no high end.  I listen to music and podcasts, and neither sounded very good.  I figured I could make do if they stayed in my ears alright.  Well, they didn't  As soon as i was sweating even the least bit, they started falling out. Every time i turned my head i'd have to adjust them. On top of that, they started losing signal randomly for minutes at a time chopping up the podcast i was listening to.  I had to turn them off and on to smooth everything out.The hook is way too big to provide any help, at least for my ears.  I tried every ear piece adapter with no luck.  The adapters i was using even started to rip after first use!  I tried running in them once just to give it one more go. Same story.  I was messing with them the whole time trying to keep them in my ears.  I realized that having the wire behind my back would constantly pull at the ear buds no matter how the wire was adjusted.  All in all, i really wanted to like these headphones, but it wasn't the case.Update 8/20/18: Mpow sent me a different pair of headphones to try out: Cheetah Bluetooth Headphones.  These seem to work much better for me.  Thanks to Mpow for the generous customer service, although it's strange that i never received an Email or any contact prior to getting a new set of headphones.","negative"
"Superior headphones for the price","If you are looking for cheap, yet well performing Bluetooth headphones these are the best option currently for around $20. They are waterproof, last around 6-8 hours, feel very comfortably, and also fit well on my ears (and probably most people). The wire is heavier and definitely not built from flimsy material either. As a matter of fact the only reason I gave these 4 stars is because while they state they receive hi-fidelity sound I would seriously doubt it considering the audio could be muncher clearer, in depth, and louder. Also, while the mic seems so pick up noise decently well, it could be better and it does not seem to cancel out much background noise from what I have been told by people who were on the other side of my calls. Overall, I didn’t expect top of the line quality for $20 so I’m still gonna day these are the best bang for your buck. Good job Mpow!","positive"
"The sound quality is unbearable.","I am so mad just by listening to songs with this piece of crap.The sound quality is so so so soooo bad no matter what songs or sound I listen to. It doesn't pull out even decent sound for neither high or low pitch. I saw many good reviews and that is why I purchased this, but I start wondering if people got this for free to write the review or something.It sounds worse than the cheapest earphones you can get from earth (I've gone through many cheap earphones). It sounds very dull and hazy. Sometimes, It is actually hard to recognize some words from songs since it was so fuzzy and dull.I feel bad since my gf got one of this too and now I have to return two pairs of earphones.I repeat, the sound is not bearable. The noise block is pretty good, since it has q-tip shaped silicon earbuds.DO NOT BUY IT!!","negative"
"Great sound, Comfortable fit, Terrific price","These have everything I wanted: Great sound, comfortable fit, the earhooks keep them in place, sweat proof, and a quality microphone. I didn't notice that they offer a 4 yr protection plan for only $2.52, which I would have added considering that my biking and mowing here in South Florida is brutal on most sports electronics.However, the price was so good, even even if they last half that long, they're worth it.","positive"
"Great headphones for the price.","Great headphones for the price. Sound great and fit great. Blue LED light lets you know when they are charged. Holding down the on button let’s you know when the headphones are connected or turning off. The headphones also give you an automated warning when the battery is low. I would definitely purchase these again.","positive"
"Absolutely love it!!! Five STARS !!!!!","Ok, so I was specifically looking for a headphone for making and receiving calls for my Samsung galaxy phone. I tried  atleast 3-4 headphones and they all failed my expectations but this headphone from Mpow is absolutely fantastic.  when I talk on my phone using this headphone, there is no disruption or interference of any type. I can hear clearly from the caller and caller can hear me with no issues. The voice is so crystal clear. Now, although I don't listen to my music from my phone using these headphone that much but really the sound bass and treble  both are great. The call/sound quality is great even with calling from apps like whatsapp or Viber I am buying another one for my wife right after I finish this review. Great product, I recommend it.","positive"
"My wife is loving at the Gym","I bought a Mpow H2 headphone that I loved the built, but it had a background noise in Bluetooth mode. I had to return and started to look for another Headphone. For my surprise, after I returned the defective H2, Mpow has contact me and offered to send a new one for another try. I immediately accepted, since I liked the quality of the product. It took some days and I got a new one. I had the chance to experiment now a perfect H2 and I can tell the sound is great and crisp and the EQ modes are perfect to adjust for music, movies, games, etc. I am feeling comfortable with them, even after several hours and the battery is lasting for 2 hours more than my previous headphone. Also the service from Mpow replacing for free my H2 was great.So as my wife wanted a new headphones for her fitness, I bought the Mpow Flame and she is loving to use in the fitness center. She says it is comfortable, the sound is great and the battery lasts. She is happy.Also my son wanted a Headphone for his games and I gave him the Mpow 059. He said the sound quality is great, clean and rich sound. I think the build quality is acceptable for this price of headphone and my son said they are adjustable enough to find perfect comfort position for hours of gaming.I can't be more happy with Mpow. Great products and great service.","positive"
"Surprisingly Happy","I have researched bluetooth headphones for awhile now. I've asked friends what kind they have and how they like them and what the battery life is like.  Well I found these and love the sound quality they are better than (my) other in-ear headphones and for battery life - they are doing amazingly well.  I get about 7 hours from them, now with that said - I pause them multiple times a day for up to 20 mins. (at times)  They are (at least seem to be) well made.  The over the ear piece is very flexable - and while I like that, sometimes its a little too flexible.  For example I have to wear reading glasses....  so if I have my glasses on and go to put these in/on it takes a minute (by a minute I mean like 7-8 secs per ear) to get the piece to go where I want it to go.  But once in place they are good to go.  I changed the stock ear pieces with the memory foam ones and they work a little too well (for work).  I don't hear anyone when they knock on my door or call my name.  But for home use - this is perfect for me!","positive"
"Good customer service from Patozon","I liked these headphones for about 8 months and then they stopped working.  Up to then I was enjoying the convenience and sound quality.  I checked for warranty/return information and found that there is a 12 month warranty.  I contacted the seller and they sent a replacement very promptly.  No charge to me.  Excellent customer service and a good product.","positive"
"Absolute Winner with a Wide Range of Uses At A Budget Minded Price","I'm just going to dive right into the pros and cons for this review.Pros:- Comfortable- Stays in your ears during even the most strenuous of movements- Sound, although not professional quality is better than other headphones in this price range and in many cases on par with headphones that are much more expensive- Controls are all located on one earbud and not on the cord (this helps tremendously with activities such as running). Buds that have the controller on the cord have the issue of the cord being too heavy causing it buds to pull out of your ear and also make for an annoying bounce of the controller against your neck during high movement activities. Both annoying and uncomfortable.- Connectivity is easy and 100% consistent. Never had an issue and range is as advertised at 30+ feet. You can pair it up with 2 devices simultaneously and as soon as you turn it on it will connect automatically.- Holds a charge for at least 3 or 4 hours. I haven't actually done an official test but I can tell you I exercise for close to an hour a day 6 times a week for an average of 5-6 hrs without having to recharge.- Cord is more of a semi stiff rubber like material that is easy on the skin and less prone to get caught on stuffCons- None that I can really think ofSo to sum it all up, these buds are amazing! I've tried a ton of different ones and these by far are the cleanest design of the bunch. Easy to operate with little to zero issues.Some suggestions though. It's best to wear these with the cord dangling in the front of you vs. the back. If you wear it with the cord behind your neck it will on occasion stick to your skin when looking left of right as it's not very long. But this essentially applies to every earbud I've tried in this class. The other thing is I would recommend only pairing these up with one device at a time despite it's capability of being able to be paired with two devices. Reason being that when you pair two devices they tend to conflict with each other and that tends to cause audio breakup and connection issues. Not always but it does sometimes so it's best to just pair it up with one device at a time.Most earbuds that are wireless will either be good for casual listening or good for exercising but never both in the same package. These earbuds work for both situations easy.Highly recommended! Now all they need to do is come up with a fully wireless version of this same design. I've already tried some others and all of them malfunctioned or had connection issues within 6 months.Not sure on the longevity of these but I've been using them for close to 7-8 months now and haven't encountered any problems to date.","positive"
"Died Just After Two Months of Use","UPDATE: I contacted the seller after leaving my review and they got back to me nearly immediate.y They sent out a replacement, which showed up two days later. As of right now I'm happy with this product despite the inconvenience. I hope this pair will last much longer than the first pair, and will update this review again if they die prematurely.I purchased this on July 7th, 2018, and am writing this review on September 3rd, 2018. I was very happy with these headphones until this morning, when they wouldn't turn on. They had been nearly fully charged, but I tried to charge them again just to make sure they hadn't drained somehow. No dice. The light will just barely flash blue sometimes when I try to turn them on, but that's it. I'm contacting the seller to see if they'll do anything and will update this review if they do.","negative"
"Great For the Price","So far I've been really happy with these.  They're lightweight but feel sturdy, audio quality is decent and fantastic for the price.  Battery life is decent.  They come in a really nice zip up carrying case that includes a couple of different sized ear pieces & the charger.  the last pair of earbuds I had were around the same price and didn't come with a nice carrying case.  I like that they're striped with red which makes them easier to find in my purse. They were easy to pair with my device.  My last pair from another brand looked similar but didn't even make it 1 year, I hope these will fair much better.  I'll update this review in a year, but so far I've been super happy with them & the price I paid for them.","positive"
"Great Bluetooth Headphones","These headphones are excellent !  I use them most of the day for the phone but also for running and working out. I typically wear out a set of headphones about every 6 months, so over the last 4-5 years I have been through a lot of different brands and models including expensive brand names. These sound very good and are well made.  The bluetooth works about 50 ft and the ear material is very comfortable to run in. I have not had them long enough to see how they will hold up but I expect it will be fine. The best part they are only a fraction of the cost of comparable products.","positive"
"Can’t go underwater, but work great.","Does not work underwater, I bought these to use for when I swim laps at the pool, but as soon as water TOUCHES them they go silent. I wasn’t expecting them to work phenomenally, but I was hoping they would work and they didn’t. But as normal Bluetooth headphones they work pretty decent.EDIT: so after my review I got an email from the company’s customer service team. They said something along the lines of sorry that the product didn’t match my expectations so we’re sending you another product, free of charge. I received this new set of earbuds a few days later and I’m actually extremely impressed with this company. Sadly I still can’t say whether they work underwater but wow, that’s some customer service.","positive"
"Comfortable and Good Sounding Headphones.","Let me get the bad out of the way (Even though technically it is not a bad).The only hiccup that I've had so far with these headphones is it took a couple of times to set up pairing these headphones with my phone. That is the one simple complaint that I have.Now the Positives (Which are Many)It's a small thing but I really enjoy the fact when a number calls in the software allows the number to be read. This may be a small thing, and something that is possibly done by more expensive headphones. This is my third pair of wireless headphones and the first that I have noticed that does this.Sound: The sound is clear and precise. Calls sound clear and the music is crisp. I'm sure more audio smart people could speak in a scientific way to explain sound quality. All I know is that the highs, lows, and bass all come through with this headset.Comfort: As long as you don't mind your headphones sticking out a little you should be good. Each persons ear canal is like a snowflake, but I was able to find a pair of buds that fit my ear.Overall:For the money you can't beat these headsets. If I had a need to have more than one pair I would definitely buy another set. Some people didn't like the over the ear hook, but I didn't even notice it was there once I started wearing them. Plus, the plastic is soft enough where it doesn't start to irritate or bother my ear. If you want a pair of headphones to use daily and at the gym I highly recommend these.","positive"
"The Best Value at 20 Bucks!","So I posted a review of these Bluetooth earbuds around a week and a half back, to which I stated my enjoyment of the pair before they cut out to the point of not being usable or being able to charge them. However, the seller Patozon reached out to me and sent me a second pair to see if my opinion would change, and guess what? It did, to a certain extent. I loved the ones I purchased the only problem was I wasn't aware of some issues that other people had which included said cutouts. So now that I have a new working pair, my Cross Country runs finally have that rich and balanced sound that I missed.These earbuds offer some decent bass while not overpowering like some of the beats by Dre products that run over 100$. Keep in mind these things are 20$! The mids and highs do compliment the as stated before strong low end for more intense workouts since even audiophiles will forget about a lot of the detail when they're sweating off gallons of fluid, speaking of which, these are IPX7 sweat/waterproof so you can take these on a run like me or to the gym, and they'll work like a charm. They come with some accessories such as multiple interchangeable ear tips to compliment different ear sizes [the default ones worked fine for me] that are extremely comfortable and snug so they do not fall out. You'll get a micro USB cable to charge it since that is a popular interface, chances are you have another cable laying around to replace it since the cable is quite short. All of these come in a compact and tough carrying case that you can fit in your pocket with no problem, and is padded for your earbuds protection. Pairing these are easy, just hold down the big red Mpow logo for a few seconds and you are ready to pair it with your phone. The battery lasts around 6-8 hours on a single charge, and since it has a sleep mode, you can use these multiple times throughout the day or even week on just a single 1 1/2 hour charge.The only drawbacks I could find was one time I could not pair them until I forgot the device and redid the connection. Also since I was sent the second one I also wish someone told me the first time that you can not let these things die, since that if you do, they will not come back. Those were complaints about an older model that seemed to boil over into this one, but always keep them charged, and you will be good to go. But, at the end of the day, these things are pretty incredible and was complimented by a seller that was very mature and genuine in their response to my first review of this product. Thanks go out to Patozon and Mpow for giving me this chance to review this product, that really left me impressed.","positive"
"absolutely frustrating trying to find the proper directions. Also very high treble","I have owned about 30 various headphones, so I know what I like and what my needs are. I bought these to wear for pool exercise, so they will only get mildly wet.  They appear to be well made, and the for the price I was not expecting much.The directions could certainly be more detailed, I  had to research on how to adjust the volume vs using the skip function.Thirty minutes later, and  I am still trying to find directions on how to swap out the ear cushions for a different size, and STILL cannot find anything! This is ridiculous.Last, but not least, the treble is so strong that it actually hurts my ears. Fortunately I was able to adjust the equalizer on my MP3 player.","negative"
"Behind the ear brace is too flimsy and large...great sound...but the new set received is phenomenal!","Headphones look great, but the soft behind-the-ear piece is...too large and flimsy, so while running/working out, they tend to come off/bend off and it becomes annoying to having them fall and and stop your workout to put them back on. Sound, pairing, and other functions are great, just that the fit is too large for my ear. I'm not sure if they make a smaller over the ear bit*Update*Changed from 3 to 5 stars. I received a better set of headphones (MPOW Cheetag) for working out and more solid fit for my style of workouts (Cardio/biking). I'd like to say their customer service is the best I've seen on Amazon and I've been ordering from Amazon for over 7 years. Great work ethic and attention to customer feedback.","neutral"
"Battery does not last long! Poor Mic Function. Interference and Weak Bluetooth connection to phone outdoors","I liked this initially as it had a good fit for my ear compared to other one I got before. But over time I do not like it as there have been some issues issues with this Bluetooth Headphone. Battery charge does not last longer like they advertised. Lucky to get 4 hrs and not the 8-10 hrs they promised. Also it has weak Bluetooth connection and interference outdoors. I use this when I mow the lawn and it has lots of interference in the music and loses connection as well.Another issue is its poor mic function. People on the other end always could not hear me well when I talk on the Bluetooth headphone. I bought this as it had lot of 5 star reviews. So far I am not happy with this one. Not sure maybe I got a defective one.","negative"
"Good buy for 20 bucks","Good buy for 20 bucks. Pairs quickly and easily. Fit is a tad finicky. Sound is surprisingly decent for blue tooth IEM's on the low end of the price scale. But be warned, it's a BASS monster. I would have probably sent them back if I didn't have a music player on my phone with adjustable EQ. I guess if you like loud, overpowering, bloated bass like, say, Beats, then you'll probably like them fine without EQ.Edit: The sound is still decent but boomy. The fit is rather fussy but luckily I found some tips in my vast tip collection that help (otherwise I was going to send them back). The cable cinch is garbage. Doesn't stay on when you try to adjust it on the fly while running or working out.","positive"
"Great sounding headphones with deep bass for under 20 bucks. What's not to like?","What the hell are people expecting that say these have poor sound quality?  Bose quiet comfort quality at a price that is close to free? I've tried several dozen headphones at this (disposable) price point over the years and these rate near the top.  Mine have a slight hiss that is noticeable when nothing is playing but it is virtually unnoticeable most of the time.  Unless they die a premature death they are a 5 star in my book.","positive"
"Died after 3 months. I do a lot of hiking and backpacking and i noticed that they tend to suck in the wind","Update: I guess someone saw my review and so they sent me a new set. I wasn't really expecting this since I threw out everything from the old one and didn't have any of the warranty information. I was actually just browsing for new ones the other day. They just showed up in the mail today, so I will keep the review updated as time goes on. Shout out to Bella at Patozon Customer Service for finding this and sending new headphones. Thank you :)They worked pretty good while they lasted. I use them a ton at the gym and a lot of hiking and backpacking, so I sweat like crazy in them. Also i noticed that they tend to suck in the wind. I'm not sure if it's a bluetooth thing or not (although I've had this problem with other bluetooth headphones), but when it's windy they cut in and out a lot. Also if I have my phone in my pocket, they pretty much cut out when I turn my head (again, has happened with other bluetooth headphones and seems to happen most if i'm on a mountain or something). After about 3 months, they just cut out on day while hiking and stopped working altogether. RIP lol","negative"
"I have thr MPow over the ears (which are hands down the most comfy headsets I've ever owned) and love them. Because I like my over the ears","I've owned Bose, Sony, Beats, and other high end bluetooth headphones. I have thr MPow over the ears (which are hands down the most comfy headsets I've ever owned) and love them. Because I like my over the ears, I decided to try the buds. Buds are usually a disaster for me because they're always too big, they hurt, and never stay in. Not so with the MPow! The smallest pads fit wonderfully, I can run and they dont fall out and they are VERY comfortable!I typically listen to.podcasts and sometimes music. The sound quality is a solid good compared to more expensive buds.. for the price you're paying for MPow... the sound is excellent.I'd definitely buy all my Mpows again. (And they came with a nice little case too, which is great!)","positive"
"$20 can get you a pretty good pair of headphones nowadays. This however isnt one of them.","$20 can get you a pretty good pair of headphones nowadays. This however isnt one of them. The audio quality isnt terrible, but dont get me wrong, its a long shot from good. Imagine going to your favorite artists concert, and then shoving cotton balls, ear plugs, and your fingers in your ears, all at once. Thats about how these sound. i wouldnt say these are overly comfortable either, go put the end of a banana in your ear and youve had the same experience. They dont stay in well, i tried all of the tips and none of them keep them in better. The hooks dont help at all either. Go feel the cord on your headphones, or your phones charging cord, thats about how sturdy they are, they arent. Over all ill give them 2 stars because they dont look terrible, but they dont function well at all. The stock headphones my phone came with out preform these.","negative"
"Great sound quality...Immersible not SUBmersible.","UPDATE!!!::After leaving the first review the seller read it and responded in the most professional and unexpected way!  Again, the sound quality is GREAT! I love using them for music and phone conversations. I also learned the difference between IPX7 (Immersion) and IPX8 (Submersible).  Thank you for making my shopping experience so pleasant!!At first....I bought these WATERPROOF headphones specifically for swimming. I had them for about 2 and a half weeks prior to using them in water. When I finally went swimming and I was so excited. I went one lap and there was a lot of statistic, by my second lap these headphones died. NO sound whatsoever.  I gave them two stars because the phone call quality was AWESOME!! The ad needs to say water RESISTANT not PROOF.  I may just get a pair for phone calls.","neutral"
"Doesn't go very loud but customer service is amazing","They're ok. Had trouble connecting to my phone at first but it did finally work. The big reason only three stars the the volume. These don't go very loud at all,I bought these the listen to music while cutting the grass. I'm not sure I'll be able to even hear the music. Function is good though and set up isn't bad. Not worth returning but I wouldn't buy againEdit: the headphones still don't to very loud but they do sound good. If you don't need them to go very loud I'd recommend. However after leaving the review the company contacted me because I wasn't happy and sent a replacement model of a newer one. Because of the customer service I have changed it to 5 stars from 3. The new model is great and goes loud. Also sounds good","neutral"
"Third time's a charm.","Really wanted to like these, but the first ones I got wouldn't charge after two weeks of owning them. I returned them and got a new pair, and now three weeks later this pair has died as well. I'd give them one star, but my son has a pair that has worked fine for about three months now, so maybe I just got unlucky? Sound quality was excellent when they worked.3/8/18 EDIT: After posting this review, a representative from the company got in touch and has offered to send out a replacement pair for me to try again. I appreciate the good service on this, and since our son's headphones have yet to experience problems, I've upgraded the review from 2 stars to 3 stars. I'll update this again after I give the replacement pair of headphones some use.8/8/18 UPDATE: Upgrading from 3 stars to 4 stars. Well, five months on now and the replacement headphones I got from the company are working fine, and my son's are still holding up too. So I'm going to attribute my first two bad pairs to bad luck. I also appreciate the company's great service in trying to make things right for me.","positive"
"Mic is weak.","They work. Sound is extremely tilted towards lower frequencies (though this is advertised, so it's my fault), making them poorly suitable for music that has other instruments but basses and drums.The microphone is extremely weak and most of the time voice typing would not work or type gibberish.Once it says battery low to the point where they turn off is very short, around 10-15 minutes. My other (and honestly much more expensive wireless headphones) have about an hour from the first announcement of battery low until it actually turns off. This is a software issue and it is strange that they built the announcement so close to the draining limit.","negative"
"They just stopped working!","They worked really well as my running headphones, with a good battery life and a clean signal to my phone. I purchased/received them at the end of May, the Amazon return window closed at the end of June, and on the first of July they stopped working. No charging light, no reaction when pressing the power button, nothing. It looks like this is a common problem, so if you are on a fixed income like me, then you should probably try a different pair.edit: I'm changing this to a 4 star review because of the customer service. Without me contacting them, Patozon sent me a free replacement pair after I posted my initial review. That is a great job for an online seller. The new pair seem to work just as well as the last pair. I won't give a 5 star review simply because the first pair failed.","negative"
"Good sound and overall good value","Not a bad pair of ear buds. I thought the sound was decent. Had good bass even if a bit muddied but they were lacking in mids and highs. The clarity needs a bit of work in my opinion. My biggest complaint is actually the comfort. Most people will find these fairly comfortable but if you have senstitive ears like I do, then the round plastic piece that pushes against the ear will begin to hurt after about 30 minutes or so. Bluetooth pairing was easy for my JS7000 Samsung TV and my LG G6 phone. They will not fall out of your ear during workouts and the battery lasts quite a while. Probably over 8 hours even at full volume. Overall I would give these buds about a 7 or 8 out of 10 depending on whether you are sensitive to the plastic pushing against your ears.","positive"
"VERY comfortable","Incredibly comfortable.  I bought these and several other styles for quiet TV watching.  After suffering through two heavy over-the-ear models, these are so comfortable I hardly realized I was wearing them.  They didn't immediately pair and, without changing anything I was doing, finally decided to pair so I will report back to make sure this is not an ongoing problem.  Of course ear buds will require more frequent charging and let in outside noise--which I prefer as I can hear my phone ring or someone who needs to talk to me without removing them.  I am comparing these to two different styles of earbuds and some retro Walkman-style on-ear headphones as well.  Right now, these are my favorites.","positive"
"Good Value","Light weight with good sound quality.  The over the ear hook is comfortable and the speaker tube is tilted so it should fit most peoples ear canal very well.  A number of different bud sized provided, mine fit great with the pre-installed one.  I was a little concerned about the wire running behind the neck but turns out I don't notice it at all.  So far, the way I use it I have not tested battery life as I tend to recharge after every use and have used only 2 hours at the most at one time.  Sound quality very good, decent bass at least to my taste.  Highs seem to be there but my old ears cannot hear much over 8k so cannot fully comment on highs.","positive"
"These are great headphones but if you don't have any sound playing","These are great headphones but if you don't have any sound playing, it makes an annoying pairing sound until sound starts to come through again. So if you pause your music to talk to someone it's kind of annoying. Other than that I'd recommend these over others as the controls are on your ears. I've had many of these, and the ones with the controls on the wire weigh the wire down which makes it want to fall out of your ear or the wire goes to one side if you're a jogger. I had the previous model and it didn't make that annoying pairing noise when there was no sound coming through, but it only lasted around 8 months due to it melting after a charge one day. We'll see how long these last.","negative"
"Definitely worth it!!!","Love!! I have a pair of beats like this but within a year they have fallen apart and I wasn’t spending that much money for an expensive pair again when I use them all day everyday. These are amazing for the price! The bass isn’t as clear but they definitely work good and the volume could be higher but beats like these aren’t that loud either. Would totally get these again! I have an iPhone and the Bluetooth buttons work with my apps I’m able to control the volume and skips on Spotify, Pandora, ect.","positive"
"Great Customer Service","***Update***The company contacted me without being promted directly, which was unexpected and really nice. They sent me a new set of headphones. They seem to be working much better. The other pair I had would cut out after 15-20 minutes while the new ones didn't cut out at all for the 90 minutes that I used them this morning. They even felt a bit more solid, but only just a bit. Time will tell how well they hold up, but I'd still recommend them if only for the excellent customer service.***Old review below***Be prepared to replace or return this product. It might be defective.My first impression of these headphones was that they feel very cheap, but I didn't pay much for them in the first place so that's not really a complaint, just an observation. Per the manual, I charged the headphones before using them.Though these headphones sound good for the price, the signal would cut out randomly and skip parts of whatever I'm listening to. I've seen other reviews with similar complaints talking about how the company sent them new headphones that worked much better, but I'm just going to return these and pick a different model since I didn't care much for the look and feel, although if the signal had worked I would have put up with it.","positive"
"Stays in your ears, lots of functions, lacks treble (minor issue)","I typically stay away from in-ear buds, simply because I find them to be uncomfortable. They also fall out really easily too. But I haven't had any of those issues with these buds. I swapped to the included memory foam buds, and they work incredibly well! Sound-cancelling is also great. Pairing is instantaneous after initial setup. Once you turn the headphones on, it's connected. There's also very little (if any) audio delay when watching videos, so you can use this for more than just music. My only slight complaint is the sound quality. It has great bass, especially for $20, but I found that what it has in bass, it lacks in treble. Vocals ended up sounding pretty unclear. I was able to fix the situation with some eqing in my Samsung S9+'s settings, but not everyone's devices will have settings like that. Also, my car stereo system is the opposite, where it has clear audio, but slightly lacks bass. The S9+ can't swap between eq settings depending on the BT device, so I'll have to redo the eq in my car too, to better match the settings in my phone. There's also a very light static sound, but you can only hear that in between songs when it's absolutely silent (really not a big deal, and shouldn't put anyone off from buying this product). But all-in-all, I'm very pleased with the buds, and will definitely be buying again in the future! The gripes sound major, but I was able to fix the eq issues in a matter of minutes. If your phone has advanced eq capabilities, cutting the 250hz range and boosting treble frequencies should help. I've attached a photo of my eq settings on my S9+. I am in no means a sound engineer, but this set up is what sounded best to me. Hope it helps!Edit: The buds also have a very light static sound. But it's only audible in-between songs when it's quiet. Doesn't affect audio fidelity at all, and shouldn't bother anyone too much.Edit #2: I've tried a second eq setup, which I've attached to the review (the one with the left-most slider raised up higher). This one has higher impact (from the kick and low toms), but still decently good clarity. This is the one I'm currently using, and will continue using. The first setup is slightly clearer, but with much less impact from low frequencies. Again, these are merely suggestions that I came upon after experimenting with the headphones. I'm in no way in expert, so you may come across a better setup. If you do, please include it in a review so others can enjoy!","positive"
"Great sound, great product for the average user.","I liked them while they worked, or for about a month, I bought them for workouts; which I sweat to the extreme, they are just not made for the type of workouts I personally can put them and all other products I've tested thus far in a gym setting, while walks and bicycle rides I have no doubt are going to be just fine, just because they could not handle what I can put them through, that is not a fair review on my end, so I would have to say they are great for the average user and in a lite workout setting, but you might consider something different if extreme sports are your thing, I'm still testing several other products, so I'm still looking too!","positive"
"Sub Par Product Good Service","Sadly, I had to return this product. This would normally get a single star review, but the customer service at Patozon was top notch and they did try to resolve the issue with replacements.  2 pairs of the headphones with the same result.  I had to keep the phone on me at all times and even then if I turned my head the connection would be lost causing garbled music.  The fit was good, I have small ear canals and the small buds included worked perfectly for me.  The sound, when not cutting out, was good with rich full sound, but I would have liked them to work at 1 notch lower of volume as the lowest setting was still a bit loud.  If not for the connection problem these would have earned a 5 star review.","neutral"
"I couldn't recommend these more","I couldn't recommend these more. I listen to my headphones a lot. At least 3-4 hours a day, and sometimes more. I usually listen through my phone, which does not have a headphone port, so it's important to me that I have a reliable pair of Bluetooth headphones on hand. I couldn't be happier with these. Upon opening the box it is immediately apparent that these are well made. Nothing about the construction of these headphones says $20. The build is solid, and they look and feel like a quality item. The sound is quite good as well. Your not going to confuse them with a $200 pair of high end headphones or anything, but your average listener will be quite staisfied. A little distortion if you go crazy bass heavy with them, but overall they sound as good or better than any other pair of lower priced headphones I've ever bought, and better than a lot of other similarly priced options. The battery life is fantastic too. I've bought Bluetooth headphones in the past that were advertised to have similar battery life and I wound up being incredibly disappointed. If I can't get at least 4-5 hours out of a charge they're of no use to me. Not a problem here. I've run them for 5-6 hours between charges, and have yet to have them die on me. Obviously, since I just received them last week I can't make any claims to their durability, however, if my current experiences with them are any indication I'll be pretty shocked if I don't get a pretty solid life out of them. I'll update again in a few months on that topic. I'm quite hard on my headphones, so if they last me they'll last anyone. Overall I can't imagine getting more for my money. Everything works as advertised, and works very well.","positive"
"Sound great, connect well, but my first pair failed after 12 hours of use [updated].","Editing this as of 17-Aug-2018The incredible team from this seller replaced the headphones and they work wonderfully. They reached out to me the day this was posted and I had a new pair the following Monday morning. Product works well and I have about 20 hours of use out of it with no issues. :)I received these in March with the intention of wearing these through triathlon training. They worked great and sounded amazing for about a month, and started cutting out with about 12 hours of use on them.Unfortunately, once outside of the return period they failed completely and would work for about an hour at a time until the sweat caused them to short. With about 30 hours of total use on them (I only wear them when I run) they finally died on 16-July; they won't charge, aren't visible by my phone, and won't come back on.Overall, they sound great and the range is awesome, but they aren't waterproof and without having purchased the 2 year protection plan on them I consider these to be disposable; for a highly rated product I don't genuinely believe a protection plan would be necessary to make it through an entire season, but the robustness of the product is sub par. They served their purpose initially but failed way too soon, especially when I have a free pair of headphones from a KLM flight that have almost 2000 hours of play time and work great.","positive"
"Good customer service. Ty for the replacement","Bought it June 8, and suddenly on aug 9 it stopped working. Like it won’t charge at all and it won’t turn on either. It didn’t got wet, it was just fine the night before and put it on my nightstand before going to bed and the next morning it was dead and won’t charged!!! Today, before writing this review we tried to charge it again and to no avail. Waste of money. I would like to return if possible!Update: 08/22/2018Seller sent me a new item to replace the one that stopped working. My husband liked it before it broke, and I bought a different headphone to replace it but he did not like the sound quality of the different brand. He is very appreciative that they gave us a replacement. He is using it right now. Thank you. good customer service.","positive"
"Super impressive for the cost","I'm actually quite impressed with these things. For $20, I was expecting them to perform like a $5 set of Walmart earbuds. I have a $30 set of Sony wired earbuds I got a couple years ago, and the sound quality is about on par. The battery life is good enough that I've used them at the gym every day for a week straight before having to recharge. The convenience of not having a cable to get tangled up in a machine or your arms is worth the price alone, even if the sound quality wasn't great. I don't know about longevity, but even if they only last six months, I've paid more for headphones that only lasted that long.","positive"
"Good battery life, good audio, good price...","In general, I think it works fine. The pairing works fine with my iPhone, although I had more difficulty with pairing it to my MotoG, although I did not try very hard as I am not using that phone any more. It is great that it comes with several ear piece sizes, so you can find a size that fits snug in your ear, there's even one which is more like a ear plug which REALLY closes out outside noise. I would use this on an airplane, but anywhere else might be dangerous, as you really isolate out the world using those earpieces (black ones).  The range is OK, nothing great, but what do you expect for such a  great low price?","positive"
"It's worth the price","Everything about these are cheap. But that's ok. So was the price. I only docked it a star due to sound quality. I bought this to replace my Mpow over  ear headset. They were actually on ear and not around ear. So I guess that's the definition or Over-ear. Anyways, they had better sound than this. But too tight and uncomfortable on my head. These put out too much bass, and not the good kind of way. More like when you play with an EQ and turn down all the mid and treble but max out the bass. Just un-natural sounding. Can't dock it anymore stars, because they are cheap, I can't expect it to compete with more expensive ones...","positive"
"Great customer service!!!","Never used because I couldn’t get them to stay on my ears, so I’m not even sure of the sound quality.  I will be returning them.Update-I can’t really speak of the quality of these particular headphones, but the customer service department was EXCELLENT!! They sent a replacement which I was able to use. The new ones did actually stay on. They do start to hurt my ears after I’ve had them on for about 30-45 minutes. I changed the ear pieces to the smaller ones. Those are better but they still hurt also. The sound quality is good. Sometimes the audio cuts off during calls, but I’m not sure if that is the earbuds or my phone. Other than that, they are good. I am very pleased with the customer service I have received from this company. If the review was just about the customer service, I would give it a 5.","positive"
"Headphones cutting out, very annoying and inconvenient","These headphones are very comfortable and the sound quality is pretty good. The bass boost sort of overpowers the treble so it just ends up sounding like a treble reduction rather than a bass boost (I think somebody else mentioned that in another review).However, the reason I'm leaving a 2-star review is because the only time the headphones DON'T cut out is when my phone is directly in front of me and slightly to the right (the bluetooth circuitry are in the right-hand side earphone). When I move my phone to my left, the sound cuts out so bad I can't hear music or anybody speaking over a phone call. What's worse is when I put my phone in my pocket, the sound cuts completely off, even though the headphones are still connected. This is not desired behavior at all.","negative"
"EXCELLENT but stopped working after a few months!","I purchased this a few months earlier this year and by July the mic started acting up, eventually, one of the earbuds started acting up and finally the whole thing stopped turning on even though the battery was fully charged. It didn't turn on, so I couldn't connect it. I gave it 4 stars because up to that point, it did everything the company purported it would do. I got another pair because while it began malfunctioning and eventually stopped working, it might have been due to my fault (maybe I didn't handle it well cause sometimes I threw it in my bag without putting it in its carrying purse). Getting another pair means I am giving the company and the product another chance (the bass level on this and the battery life is pretty dope y'all). So, if this new pair begins acting up in the next few months, I will utilize the warranty process and come back to change this review/rating to a lower one.  Give it a shot though folks.","neutral"
"Love them, had to buy two","I lost my first pair after only a couple weeks, but I had to instantly buy a new pair. I walk dogs and it's a lifesaver to listen to podcasts with these without a cord going into my pocket, while being able to control it and answer calls with the buttons on the ear piece. It's surprising just how much you can do with short/long presses on the few buttons - play/pause, on/off, pick up / hang up, fast forward / rewind, refuse call, etc. The various earpiece sizes make sure they're comfortable (they even added a memory foam set for weird ears that seem like a post-manufacture add on), and the battery life is pretty good considering their size and weight. I would definitely recommend them; just be careful not to lose them as they're not tethered to your phone!","positive"
"Spoke with customer service!","Update: I feel a lot better about the replacements (I've had them aboit a week now), I can now get just under the 10m distance that's stated before it starts to sound like static. And I can now bend towards the ground withouth them messing up. The ear part still bugs, but I have smaller ears so it's expected. Overall, they're recommended.Add on: The company's customer service is spectacular so far. They are actually working on getting me a new one right now, so I will update as soon as I receive it! 😊Original Review:They work fine as long as your device is right next to you. Even being five feet away causes them to cut out, which defeats the purpose of bluetooth devices. The part that fits behind the ear is made for people with dumbo sized ears since it isn't adjustable. I still use them even. So good enough for now.","positive"
"Great value. Didn't kill my puppy.","The sound quality is on par with some headphones three times the price. I admit I went in with low expectations, but these sound almost as good as the first generation of Beats in-ears I used to have... at just $20.I can't speak to how they hold up over time, though, because my puppy ate them. Relieved to say that with even with deep teeth marks, the battery didn't explode.Thanks, Mpow, for not killing my dog.","positive"
"I’ve had two different sets in the last three months and they work great till they don’t","Don’t ever let these headphones die. They cannot come back from dying. I’ve had two different sets in the last three months and they work great till they don’t. To the company’s credit they do have an 18 month warranty where you can exchange or be refunded for broken headsets. They have fast customer service as well. I just don’t think these headphones are good quality if they can’t be charged after the battery dies. I am dissapointed, I loved my headphones and they seemed like a fantastic value until they died. I thought initially I had a bad set but when it happened to the replacements mpow sent me I began to think it was a manufacture defect of the product and I don’t care to keep getting replacement after replacement. I’d rather invest my money in something that will work better.","neutral"
"Worked great... for almost 3 months. (EDIT: Company sent me another one.)","EDIT (9/9/2018): Upon my posting this review, the seller reached out to me and sent me another one.  I'll update the review in a couple of months with how well the new one is doing.  The seller does deserve credit for excellent customer service at least.The original review of my first pair:  For awhile I really liked this pair of headphones. The sound quality was better than I was expecting for something at this price. Much better than the wired earbuds I've used in the past. I liked going cordless and they're very comfortable. Then the problems started after about two months. At first they'd have trouble connecting to my devices unless I turned them on and off a couple of times. I began to have connectivity issues causing the audio to skip and stutter when my phone was in my pocket. Then the audio notification they give you that tells you they're turning off quit working. Now they've just flat out frozen and are stuck with the LED indicator a steady red after charging. They're not responding to any button presses. I'll probably stick with wired earbuds from now on for something longer lasting.","negative"
"I sweat like a pig...","For the cost, this headphone rocks. I've used it for a few weeks now and the initial charge straight out of the box lasted 6 hours. I sweat like a pig at the gym and these headphones held up nicely with no issues. Sweat got into my ears and into the earbuds too, and I simply wiped it off while on the treadmill and it was working with zero issues. Bluetooth connects faster than another of my other Bluetooth devices. I purchased these to test if I would like this style of headphone before purchasing something higher end. At this point, there's no need, I'm perfectly happy with these.","positive"
"Wife Captured the First Pair","These headphones work great. I bought them to jog and listen to music and they work so well I forget they are there. They have quite the range of functionality and I haven't figured out all of it yet, but that's me, not them. My last ditch effort will be to actually read the instructions but since I used them right out of the box I believe they are very common-user friendly. My wife wanted to try them out and she held them hostage until I bought her a pair (pink). They are flexible in sizing and work well in the rain. I can't get my glasses to fit with them very well but they CAN be worn with them. Recommend!","positive"
"Terrible for people with small ears! UPDATE 9/17","I was very disappointed to see that the earhook is not adjustable as advertised. This made it difficult for the ear piece to stay on comfortably. I really liked the sound quality but comfort was completely lacking. I compared these to my boyfriends power beats and noticed a complete difference in how they fit. The earhook hovers over the top of the ear and looks oversized for women’s ears. Also had my boyfriend try them on and the ear hook still hovered over his ears. This product was designed poorly which is unfortunate so to the great sound quality of these headphones. If I didn’t plan on using them for working out I would think about keeping them but there is no way they are staying in while running. Will be returning them soon for a refund!UPDATE: So they sent me the MPOW cheetah headphones and unfortunately they did not fit well either. So I ended up returning both sets of headphones. I wish I could have kept them because they had really great sound quality. Customer service was really great and tries to help in whatever way possible.","negative"
"good price, sound little muffled and muted somewhat","I believe it is pointless to put a review of sound quality for sub $30 Bluetooth so I will stick to my overall satisfaction.good price,  sound little muffled and muted somewhat. but definitely better than another sub $30 Bluetooth...those are unbearable. At least this does not feel like disposable. I bought for gaming anyway and I don't complain. I usually use my HiFi system so maybe I am picky.it has punchy bass. very little hissing sound. (I want to emphasize that even 300 dollar ones still have little hissing) under $30 you can not find any better ones than this..so far I am really enjoying it.","neutral"
"Questionable ability to stay in place, poor sound quality; I have to return these.","I bought these as a replacement for my 3rd set of SoundPEATS wireless headphones, which were similarly priced and sized (interestingly, the female voice that tells you when the headphones connect to your Bluetooth device sounds exactly the same).  So I will be mostly comparing these two sets of headphones.Although I was quite satisfied with the performance of the Q9A model SoundPEATS, the contacts in the charging port in every set of SoundPEATS would come apart after ~6 months, rendering the headphones unchargable, and due to design of the charging part, effectively irreparable. The charging port looks the same on this Mpow set, but I plugged them in and charged them up very quickly.  I didn't much care for the ear loops, which seem to be unreinforced/loose and larger than the loops on the SoundPEATS.  The headphones themselves are light though, and the ear plugs fit snugly into my ears; they stay in while walking, but I don't know if they will stay in while jogging.  I can say that the SoundPEATS also fit snugly though, both due to the ear plug portion as well as the smaller reinforced loops, and they never fell out despite many miles of running and countless workouts in the gym.The initial pairing with the Mpows and my iPhone 7 was nearly effortless, and subsequent attempts to connect have been lightning fast, even faster than with the Q9As.  Unfortunately, my experience with these headphones basically ends shortly thereafter, due to sound quality.  The sound is very muddied and muffled, almost to the point of being painful.  Lots of what seems to be low frequency that I cannot adjust out, simply with the built in EQ on the iPhone.  For comparison, I never changed the EQ settings with the Q9A or Apple wired headphones, and those both sounded clean and clear for all uses (music, podcasts, phone calls).  I tried a few different kinds of music that I listened to often with the other headphones, as well as a few different podcasts, which I listen to daily, and I just couldn't take the sound.  In fact my ears are ringing a bit right now.I bought these simply based on the average high ranking they got on Amazon, but they are unfortunately unusable for me.  I'll be sending them back tomorrow.","negative"
"Good headphones!","They work great when inside a building. They don't take a ton of battery life from my device(s), they don't take a minute or so to pair (it's been nearly instant every time so far).The battery lasts somewhere around 4 or 5 hours of constant music.After half an hour, they become uncomfortable. Before that, they fit snugly in my ears with no real problems. They're almost noise cancelling, but not quite. More heavily muffling noise.Apparently, I live in an area where bluetooth headphones will skip on bright, sunny days...but not on rainy days? No idea why, but if I go outside on a sunny day they start skipping. On a cloudy or rainy day, they play perfectly. Same route, fully charged each time, even used different devices to test it. Not sure what causes it.The case has enough space in it to easily put them back in without worrying about tangling or damaging wires.Speaking of wires, the connecting piece is so comfortable that I sometimes forget it even exists when I go to take the headphones off, which is both a pro and a con. On the one hand, I don't notice them while walking. They don't itch or cause any irritation. On the other hand, I sometimes end up tugging on the string from one side or the other when I go to take them off (esp if I only have one in my ear, with the other hooked on my shirt or something).","positive"
"Good spare...","I use this for a spare headset if my main goes down. I tested it pretty thoroughly... The sound is outstanding and better (louder) than I expected. It lasts at least 9 hours (the spec). It's surprisingly comfortable. Overall it's an excellent spare (usually use a Logitech G933 wireless set)! BTW  Logitech rules (been using their equipment for years!)","positive"
"BROKE WITHIN TWO WEEKS...","They broke within two weeks -TWO WEEKS!- of the time I started using them. I am very disappointed. They worked great before they broke. Instant Bluetooth connection. Good volume. Nice controls.... However, there's no point in how great they work if they stop working within two weeks of you using it. I only wore it when I went walking, so no extra wear or tear.UPDATE: Their customer service is great. The seller contacted me within hours of me emailing them about my situation. They promised me to replace my headphones. (Thank you!) I will update my review when the new one ships in.","negative"
"Fantastic","I dont own a car. I use public transport/uber to get around (its easy in the DC area). These are fantastic. They dont drown out sound 100%, but then again, I dont want that...cause I need to hear if a car is coming around the corner while crossing the street. The sound doesnt escape the headphones into the general public either, so I can listen to my music/podcast without disturbing people on the shuttle or metro. I also use them for running/rowing/weightlifting. Basically, they are in my ears for many hours a day. For the money, you cant go wrong with these.","positive"
"Fantastic headphones for the price!!!","Wow! I received my pair today, and I'm blown away with how good they sound. I seriously didn't expect an inexpensive set of Bluetooth headphones to have such rich bass. I have these paired to my Google Pixel 2 XL, and as long as I keep the volume at 90% or less, they sound great! Pushing the volume to 100% you can hear distortion of the bass, but otherwise I simply love them. I also tested the call quality, and so far I've been told that they sound excellent. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for something that sounds good, looks great, is lightweight, and isn't going to break the bank.","positive"
"Good for the price except battery performance","Good design, good usability.Okay'ish sound quality and bad battery playback time.Pros:1. wireless headphones with mic: the mic is able to pick up the voice clearly. I don't have to speak loudly when I'm using these. call quality is also good. The headphones announces the phone number of the caller and you can attend the call by pressing the main button on headphones.2. play/pause, sound+/- are controlled by buttons on headphones.3. good Bluetooth connectivity: have connected it to my laptop and phone without issues. Pairing with google home is not so smooth.4. good design: good for running - won't fall off, won't hurt your ears.Cons:1. battery: description says 7-9 hours playback time. Not true - I could hardly get 6 hours at less than 50% volume. Also, the battery indication is inconsistent - it would say 70% on your connected phone and then the battery might die out in 2 hours. 90% to 70% would go for around 2 hours.2. Sound quality: It's not bad but doesn't feel complete. I used a decade old each Sony over the ear headphones and then tried these - It feels the sound has some low frequencies missing. I'm not a sound expert so can't explain it that well.","neutral"
"excellent value","Just got these to use while walking on a treadmill...  Excellent value !  Instantly and effortlessly paired with my basic Samsung J3.  Downloaded Spotify on my son's suggestion.  Wow, all the music I like free playing through these airweight headphones is EXACTLY what I needed for my new fitness program.  I've never owned headphones before and i'm not comparing these to 300.00 dollar brand name product but for 20 dollars you can't go wrong. Light, comfortable, and decent sound that pairs instantly for a tech dunce like myself !!  Nice little case too !","negative"
"Good call quality","Just arrived today but I'm already impressed. They have great sound quality, easy to use, easy to connect.  Biggest thing is that people can hear me fine on my phone calls! I like that it came with different sized ear pieces, though it was a small struggle to figure out how to swap them without damaging them.  I wish there was some explanation of the black buds that came with it (just a different style than the clear or do they serve a specific purpose?)It's not with knocking off a star but I do wish the carrier had a clip on it. I carry a small clutch, not a purse or bag, so I wish I could clip it on.2 things I have not tested yet are how well the sound & call quality are from my car while driving, because there's quite a bit of road noise, and also how well they stand up to sweat.  We shall see.But so far I'm very impressed with them","positive"
"Poor quality headphones. Stopped working. UPDATED: received replacement, will try again UPDATED 2: working great.","UPDATED 2: Have been working very well.  The replacement pair are quality. Buy these as they are excellent value. Customer service is also VERY good. UPDATED: I received a replacement from the seller.  I will try them again to see how they perform (i.e. if they work as expected).  Sound quality was good on the first pair but the durability was poor.  I increased my rating from 1 Star to 3 stars because of the seller's quick and positive response to my situation. Will add another star(s) after using the replacement for a while to validate durability.Headphones worked very well until yesterday.  Then they simply stopped working.  Now they won't turn on, won't charge, etc.  I've only had these headphones for a couple of months.  Poor quality that is best avoided.","negative"
"Great Customer Service!!!","Changing my 1 star to 5 star -- Fantastic Customer Service. .Works perfect with iPhone and Windows computer. Can pause/stop music and answer phone. I have had phone, windows, and android all connected to same bluetooth headset at same time.Great Sound.  Took a while to find the the right set of buds (they give you 3 different sizes).Only things to improve - the rubber thing which is supposed to shorten the length of the strap does not work well. If your neck is exposed ( i.e. no long hair) the strap will stick to your neck when you are sweating.Of you want to sleep with these on - does not work well if you sleep on your side - get something that fits inside the ear better. Why the GREAT Customer Service?. I had a set that I was happy with and recommended to my son. The left ear stopped working after 45 days. I posted a review as it was 15 days after return policy of 30 days. Lo and behold a new set shows up in my inbox. FANTASTIC Customer Service.  Thanks.","positive"
"AMAZING","I absolutely love these! They work perfectly. The sound that comes from them is great and they have completely changed my running game. It's so fantastic to not have to worry about a cord getting tangled or disconnected. I have nothing bad to say about them. It took a while for me to get used to them with my daith piercing, but I figured out a way to be able to have them in comfortably and not take the piercing out. They really have a great battery life. I'll forget to charge them for a couple weeks and they still don't run out of battery. I LOVE them!","positive"
"Better than expected!","Hi. Well, I took the bait as it was listed as an Amazon Choice and had 7500 or so reviews. Anyway, it took 2 tries to link the blue tooth for some reason? Also, at first the bass response was not good as some had mentioned in their reviews. Then, suddenly, the bass came alive on the 3rd Pandora song ‘Grand Funk’ - Closer to my home’ which has tons of bass. I’m not sure why. Also, adjusting the ear pieces make a big difference. Anyway, I am really enjoying this headset. It’s comfortable, sounds wonderful, and has a nice carrying case. Plus it’s only $20.Great and highly recommend it!","positive"
"Good, but not perfect. Uncomfortable wire. But I have found a solution (pls read)","1 week into using them. Jogging and walking. To early to say if they will last.2 comments off the bat:- the round rubber clip holding two side of the wire together is USELESS. It rolls out whenever the wire stretches (i.e. you turn your head).- The headphones wire is UNCOMFORTABLE in the back. When turning your head, it catches your neck, or pinches it. NOT GOOD. However there is a solution. Just tuck the wire into your baseball cap. Please see the images.Other than that solid 4 stars.","neutral"
"Great Buy!","I haven’t had these long enough to give the battery life a fair review, but I feel good about commenting on the rest.At $20, I didn’t expect the best sound ever, but with other good reviews spread out over 7,000+ reviews, I felt good about giving these a try.These $20 headphones beat out the $70-$80 pair of LG’s that I once had for the gym and car.Sound quality-I’m not the one who can typically tell the difference between really good and great, but I do feel really good about the sound that comes from these. It’s clear, doesn’t muffle, and plays plenty loud enough.Material quality-I wasn’t sure what to think about he cord that goes between the earbuds, but after using them, I can say that the cord is just fine. The cord on my old pair was weighted, which caused the cord to bounce (not a big deal, but annoying when exercising). This cord is not and it rests without bugging you. The earbuds are really comfortable too!Phone Calls-I asked my wife to go in the other room while I called her when I got these. She could hear me clearly she shared. I could hear her and carry on the conversation with no issues.Battery Life-Like I said above, I haven’t had these long enough to drain the battery, so I can’t rate the headphones in that aspect. However, for the price and quality of the rest of the headphones, 2-3 hours at a time would make me happy.Overall-I got more than what I paid for. I don’t like to pay more for something unless I absolutely have to. I try and read reviews before hand, and it paid off this time. At $20, these headphones are a steal and I would recommend them to anyone.","positive"
"Susceptible to Interference & Noise, Bad for Outdoor Use, Great for Indoor Gyms","I went to acquire a pair of wireless headphones as I often run on the treadmill and weight-lift in my routines, and it sucks greatly to use over-the-ear headphones for those due to how often they fall off.I came across these looking to headphones that hung around the ear, as I found those to be the most comfortable in exercising. Ordered it, and it came quickly and in great condition!I sat it down to charge overnight before taking it for a test the next day on all sorts of things: track-running, stretches and calisthenics, and weight lifting. Here are my thoughts on the headphones.Goods:One: The headphones are convenient and easy to setup. Pairing and getting it access on Bluetooth was good.Two: The cord length is at a good length. It's not too long that it dangles or catches like mad, but not too short that I would feel my ears tug (more on that later).Three: The set of earbuds are good for differing ear sizes.Four: Battery life is excellent! Did a 4 hour session and the things still held power.Bad:One: I don't know what modules or methods they use for the Bluetooth to link with the device, but this device flickers like mad on a hint of interference. Running outside, I often run into problems where the headphones just flat-out lose connectivity for a minute at a time before playing music again. My phone isn't pausing or interfering with the music, and I noticed this to happen in corridors or heavily wooded areas, making me think the Bluetooth is not high quality (if Bluetooth reverberates within a corridor it can cause itself to break contact (or lose sound) with the device its connected to). It's a definite problem as it means I can't use these when running trails or hiking in woods like I hoped.Two: The cord material they used must have some tactile issue, because it keeps grabbing at hairs or fabric weirdly. This is a major issue for me as I have long hair, and I prefer not to band-tie my hair. More importantly, this blows greatly for crutches as it can grab at carpet or mats and tug the headphones on my ears. In some cases I have had the earphones flat out fall off because the cord would not follow through with sit-ups. Having to stop to re-adjust is therefore annoying.Overall, these can do well for exercise and if one's intention is to use it for running and weight lifting, it works fine. However, these headphones do not hold well if one has long hair, or if your services for mats are carpet or plastic/rubber, as it'll keep catching. The headphones also suffer in regions of other Bluetooth or signal devices (don't expect it to hold quality if you jog through a city or go into woods). Great for indoor use, horrible for outdoor use is my opinion.","negative"
"These worked great..","These worked great... for a few weeks. Suddenly they have simply stopped working. I was using them this morning just fine, then I plugged them in to let them charge, and when I went to turn them back on later... nothing. I plug them in now, and the light indicator doesn't come on at all. They won't turn on, and I have no clue why. They were fully charged and now seem to be dead. Really unfortunate. I enjoyed these while they worked.","neutral"
"Good product, minor issues","This product is pretty good, and I enjoy it, but it has a couple minor issues. It came in a nice little carrying case (that I've already lost, but... there's no way to avoid that) and it looks really great. The instructions are a little wonk, but you can get it figured out. My first issue was that it continually blinks a little blue light, and as I wear glasses, that reflects into my eye and is really distracting. I was super excited when I saw kinda ear-plug-esque replacements for the regular ear buds, and at first they were great, but in a week they'd already pretty much disentigrated. And since I lost the case I don't have the other replacements, but that's my own damn fault. The sound quality is pretty nice, and the battery lasts a very reasonable length of time.","neutral"
"Excellent Product, works as described","I ordered these to use while exercising in the pool. Thankfully I have not yet had to find out if they are indeed water proof but they do work very well- I have had problems with set up on other blue tooth headphone's and typically I cannot see the small writing or symbols on them to know what they are for-  on, off, volume up or down, etc. but these are easy to use, easy to understand set up. I do not know how to use them to answer a call but that was not why I bought them so its not important to me. What is important is that they stay in place, they have great range, sound great and connected with my phone easily.","positive"
"One major flaw on an otherwise good product.","Cons:  1.  No easy way to talk to your digital assistant.  As I run, I listen to podcasts and I run longer than the length of most podcasts I listen to.  I like to say Hey _____, Play Podcast ____ and have her switch to another podcast.  I read the directions and can't do that with just these earphones.  2.  The plastic that covers the wire connecting the two earphones sticks to my neck as I sweat.  That stuck wire can cause an earphone to become loose in my ear as I turn my head and the wire won't give.Pros:  1.  Large range of volume to match your preference.  2.  Earphones sit securely and comfortably in my ear.  3.  Good sound quality.  4.  Work as expected (other than not being able to talk to your digital assistant).Conclusion:I would buy again but only if I couldn't find a model that allowed me to give verbal directions to my phone.","neutral"
"**UPDATE - Great support!!  (old review - Starting to cut out after a weeks use  - not liking it.)","**UPDATE**After reporting the problem, I was contacted by the support folks and they shipped me out a new one right away!  Didn't even ask for the old one to be shipped back!  New one seems to be working just great.  Changing my review from 1 to 4 stars (would have been 5 if I had no problems at all).  Thank you for your great support!----------I've had these for about a week and am starting to notice cut-outs when using them at times.  Have not been able to pinpoint the problem though.I use them primarily to listen to audio books from Audible, HooplaDigital and Google Play, so I don't think it's because of those vendors software/apps.  What happens is this:  I will be listening to a book and all of a sudden the audio starts to sound like it's skipping - missing every other word or so.  This goes on for a while (sometimes minutes) before it clears up, but then happens again after about 10 minutes of 'good' listening.  It's starting to drive me crazy!  The programs all work fine via the bluetooth in my car though.  And yes, they are fully charged as is my phone.  Happens when I have phone in one of my pockets or holding in my hand.I have another headset (single) that works fine but my wife is borrowing it for when she's driving so I am pretty sure it's not my phone either.  I will wait until she gets back in town this weekend to double check it.  And yes, I have tried resetting it, resetting my bluetooth, pretty much everything that I (as a computer tech) can think of.  And no, I didn't use a high voltage charger, just plugged it into my laptop to charge up.Might be time to return it and get a different brand.","positive"
"Excellent Deal! Superb Product","This is quite a deal! The battery lasts arounf 7 hours. Charges fast. It works well for answering calls. Also, if you hold both volume buttons down, it activates OK Google. I can command it to play some music, while i am in my garage working. The phone could be somewhere else in the house. Pretty good at receiving signal. It starts to crackle at about 50 ft.","positive"
"The sound quality is quite excellent for the price and the portable hardcover case that ...","Overall, some very robust earpieces. The IPx7 rating allows for them to be used in a a wide variety of conditions, traveling with your phone without hardware damage. The sound quality is quite excellent for the price and the portable hardcover case that that the item comes in can carry a few extra items. The matte colors are favorable as they yield less visible fingerprints/dirt on the earbuds.Pros:Sound quality is crisp and clearMic is on the same level or better than most $60 wireless headsets' micsEarbud hook allows animated activities without worry of earbuds falling outDifferent sizes of earbud tips allow comfort and good fitLine attaching the earbuds is a good length for an individual to use. Sharing an earbud with another person is a pain though and one might find themselves wishing for it to be longerEasy-to-reach buttons and quick buttons responseSurprisingly does have around 7 hours of battery life when volume is at mediumLower power voice that sounds when earbuds have low power come on 15 minutes before earbuds dieCons:Battery indicator on phone is WILDLY inaccurate. NEVER trust it as it is always wrong.Occasionally earbuds refuse to be discoverable. This does not happen often, however.Animated activity will easily dislodge earpieces from ears after a few minutes.","positive"
"Very good headset for a very good price","Let me start by saying I have only had this headset for about a week at this point. Initial impression is it is a very good headset given the price. I have struggled to find a headset with earbuds that actually fit in my ears so I need the aid of the loops over my ears for when I am running or working on things. I typically don’t buy expensive headsets because they do not last any longer than the cheaper ones.The sound quality of this set is not something I would say is as good as a set of over the ear headphones but it is pretty good. I use this headset for listening to music and watching videos as well as for phone calls. The reports I am getting from people on the other end of the calls is that the sound quality is fine, better than some of my other, more expensive units.The headset was ready to go right out of the package. They were charged. I don’t know if it was a full charge so I charged them and paired them to my phone and tablet. Pairing was simple and quick.I would recommend this headset if you are looking for a good headset in this style and this price range. Again, I have had this unit for only a week. If they go bad early, I will update this review.","positive"
"Audio breaking up - Updated","UPDATE: Seller sent me a replacement, the issue has improved.  I'll revise again if I notice the issue coming back.  Also, be sure to turn off the wake gestures on your phone.  The waking seemed to cause audio cut outs for me as well.I bought these to wear while mowing, biking or sitting in my office mainly listening to podcasts on my phone.  During the first use I experienced periodic breaks and crackles in the audio.  This was with my phone in my pocket.  Not really happy about that because it's really distracting.","negative"
"Exactly what is promised.","These are the best headphones  I have ever had for working out or running. Everything is easy to use, they stay in your ears and do not slip out, and are not bothered by sweat or water. The sound quality is excellent and I am still amazed at their price. These are far better than headphones I have purchased in the past for 3 to 4 times the cost. I have recommended them already for five of my friends and will continue to give the product praise.  Another nice feature is the earbuds…They are made out of gell rather than foam… They foam buds I’ve had in the past fall apart quickly...These jelly earbuds are not fragile and stay in place.","positive"
"Sound just ok. Power only lasts a day.","Sound just ok.  Power only lasts a day.Addendum:  Company has been extremely responsive to my initial review of 3 stars for sound just ok, power lasts only a day.Without request, they sent me a replacement and have been very interested in my experience with it.  I appreciate they want me to have a positive experience.I can say that the second set they sent me has much better power and sound.  Who knew?Thank you for your professionalism!Upgraded the rating to a 5.","neutral"
"Stopped working,REVISED 3-13","Received product 12-1-17 and worked fine at gym pretty much every other day until today 3-6-18. The headphones were actually very good for price until there was a high pitch sound for 5 to 7 seconds today and than product stopped working. Will not even take charge. I have just sent request into seller asking for replacement. Will update in fullfilled.***UPDATE, company replaced set and was VERY prompt and EASY to deal with, 6 days later I have new set and I even was unavailable for a day before responding to company,  3 star rating due to problem with first pair, otherwise for price it could be a 5 star.","negative"
"Terrible microphone","Sound is great for the price, the microphone is TERRIBLE. it is choppy and cuts in and out. If you aren't looking to talk through these, buy em. Otherwise, keep looking.UPDATE 6/19/19: I am  updating my review from 2 stars to 4 stars because the seller (Patozon) reached out to me upon reading this review and has replaced the headset with the newer model. I have not received them yet and do not know if they are any better, but I am extremely impressed with the effort the seller went through to make my experience a better one. Although the headphones sounded great, the mic was terrible, so maybe purchase a different model from Patozon!","negative"
"Just ok. Updated:customer service, made up for it.","It does it's purpose, sound quality obviously is not the best but it is serviceable. The battery life is pretty bad though, I have to charge it at the end of the day everyday ( i do use it for about 5 to 6 hours a day but that should not require daily charges).  I also wish the earpiece is adjustable the loops are way too big for me and just serve to weigh it as it does not hang off my ears at all. Overall it's ok, but I wont buy it again once it breaks.Update: the company sent me a newer set and it does fit better and sound is also good.","negative"
"Meh they are okay","Update:The company sent another set of headphones in response to my first review.I continue to stand by my review of the original set of headphones hence why I will keep the rating at a one star. They are a good deal for the price. They work fine but I don’t like the echoing of the cord every time you touch the cord.The 2nd set of headphones were not the same kind. They are the Cheetah version which looks to be a step up from the ones I purchased so I legitimately cannot change the rating of this review based on the replacements as this is a totally different set of headphones.  The cheetahs are better with the echoing as the cord does not dangle and have decent sound.I’ll give the company 4 stars for customer service as they messaged me and sent a new pair. They are very interested in ensuring you are happy I appreciate this but they sent another email after receiving the 2nd headphones asking me to change my review. I’m not sure I agree with this tactic since the review is for the product itself and the product is not faulty I just don’t like it.Original review below:The headphones are alright. What I don’t like is the sound quality. Every time You touch the  cord that connects the two headphones you can hear a thud type sound. Or While running almost as if echoing as the headphones or cord moves.  Not impressed and not sure how these headphones have so positive many ratings.","neutral"
"Wow! What a pair of headphones for the price.","I was very hesitant about buying bluetooth headphones, especially headphones that were very expensive.  I have several other bluetooth speakers, and those vary a lot in their signal strength, so anything bluetooth I am always wary of.  However, that being said, these little headphones are SO GOOD.  I bought myself and my wife a pair of them, and my wife uses them 10x as much as I do and she has them on all the time as she is going about the house listening to audio books.  I also tested the signal quality across the house and through an outside door and they are very reliable.Pros:lightweight, charges quick, excellent battery life, super nice build quality, very comfortable (has a good variety of ear pieces), snazzy and compact carry case, no tangled cable from the phone, great audio quality, a connector cord so you can just dangle the headphones, superb connection quality, and most of all, PRICE.Cons:When it says battery low it means you have just a couple minutes (from my experience)!  HOWEVER, this is also a positive because it will go right to the end of the battery, like a good quality device should.  I can have a couple very extended listening days before I need to charge.  See, I spun that negative back into a positive.If you were on the fence about bluetooth headphones like I was, just go for something like these and you will not be disappointed.  I have two pairs and I am super impressed.","positive"
"Decent for the price, if you want ear pain","The overall design is very ergonomic, looks good, minimal wire tangle compared to my oldder bluetooth headset that had a collar based design. Easy to use and very simple, was excited to get these. However, the sound quality is very subpar. There is a little bass (when volume is turned up, you get a hint of it) and reaches decent high tones. However, it might be a defect in my unit, but the left ear has a persisting high pitched whine for 5s after sound has passed through the ear piece. The upside is it was 20$, downside is, so was my old headset i got off groupon, and these are magnitides worse in sound quality. You get what you paid for, will be looking to refund.Quick customer service, I was sent the Mpow cheetah as a replacement, I'll copy and paste the review I did for that product here:I was sent a pair of these as replacement for another mpow product that arrived faultyPretty user friendly, the controls are simple to use and the sound quality is decent. The headset mainly relies on the earbuds and some squeezing pressure (more on this next) to stay on. It doesn't feel like the headset will fall off in normal everyday use, but it may come loose in strenuous activities.The band that connects both sides of the ear pieces is made of a stiffer plastic material that holds its original bent form. While it curls up nicely to fit in your pocket, it does take a minute to unravel and figure out the orientation of the ear pieces; because of the connecting band, the headset also tends to squeeze inward around your neck instead of resting on around your collar bone; not a lot of pressure, it feels like a throat mic headset if you've ever worn one. Over time the plastic does relax a bit and it's less noticeable.The issue with the band was -1 star, but the excellent response time of the customer service earned the +1 star back for 4 stars total","positive"
"I was like daaaang!","My lil homie Bummy Z had a pair kinda like deez and I'm like Yo what's them pieces on yo earz mang? He said Dawg these them Mpow joints they sick. I had to floss them things asap!Head over to the Amee Z and dang they on sale! I'm all bout it!Them pieces came to my pad  super quick like side chick when baby mama goes to work.Right away I put them thangs on my ears, paired that shizz, and bro you don't even know! They was all BLAMM! Bass all like BOOM POW! Lil Bummy Z was right! Deez ain't no joke! Now I walk through work to my IT office cuz you know I be spittin and slingin knowledge on that PC/Mac game and all the work tricks be like heeyyyy.That's right... Thems Mpows!","remove"
"These headphones aren't going anywhere!","You know what doesn't fall out of your ears? THESE THINGS. They stay in during runs, even while wearing glasses, and I've even used them for workout videos on my phone so I don't wake everyone up while the instructor yells motivation at me. The sound is really good--especially for the price--so I even use them at work. They were really easy to sync with my phone and they stay charged for a surprisingly long time. 10/10 would buy again!","positive"
"Pretty good for the price","I used this market when I'm doing my indoor biking. It starts secure during my intervals, whether I'm sprinting or riding tempo. It comes with various sizes of the rubber ends that go into your ears, and the smallest one works very well for me (I have small ear holes). It has worked through multiple sessions of biking so far, through a lot of sweat without any issue. So far so good. Bluetooth connectivity distance is pretty good, I can leave the iPad in my living room and walk to my kitchen without any issues.","positive"
"Not good for sensitive ears","I've only used it for about a day or so. The sound quality isn't as good as I hoped it was (to me it sounds a little muffled).I usually don't listen to music very loud but this earphones can't go very low when it comes to volume adjustment (perhaps this is an issue with bluetooth earphones)After working out about 30 minutes and listening to music (on the lowest volume). I took it off and it felt like a relief and my ears feel a little discomforted (usually happens when I listen with bad wired earphones)So, if you dont' have sensitive ears and prefer loud music (quality is not very good but its $20 earphones) then this could work for you but definitely not for me","negative"
"(UPDATE) Didn't work properly after two weeks but Patozon worked with me to correct this issue.","UPDATE as of 6/27/18: I have to thank Patozon for such excellent customer service.  Not only did they address the issue with my headphones but these new headphones work like a dream. So far I am very satisfied with quality and sound my new headphones and I have had no problems what so ever. I can honestly say I would recommend the company and product to friends because they know to address and correct issues with their customers in a timely fashion.-----------------------------------------------------------(OLD) Unfortunately, I only recently open this device after purchasing it back in April. It worked perfectly for 2 weeks before I notice that the sound quality dropped and the wires had a short on it causing the songs to skip or short out. Would not recommend at all.","positive"
"Died after 4 months. Company replaced them! THANK YOU!!!","***** UPDATE *****The vendor contacted me right after I posted the issues I had with the headphones dying on me. They immediately sent me out a replacement set which work perfectly. EXCELLENT customer service. It is great to find a company that makes good on a product, even if the product is just out of warranty.I loved these headphones for the first few months. I really wanted a pair that was waterproof since I run with them all the time. About a week ago they started to malfunction intermittently while I was out running and became difficult to charge. Now they are completely dead. And of course, they are just out of the warranty period!","positive"
"Worth The Purchase? Yes","These are pretty good and I have used them several time now but I am not a heavy user. One thing that is important to me is the ease a Bluetooth item pairs with the equipment I already have. The headphones have paired very well with my other devices so that alone would get me to purchase these again. The sound is fine for what I need which is watching TV at night so as no to disturb others and listening to music on my phone. They do everything they are advertised to do and I am happy with the purchase.","positive"
"Why not try it? It's Cheap and reliable.","I've always had problems with headphones that go in the ear since the ear canal in my right ear is a little smaller. But with using the squishy attachments it comes with I can wear them a lot longer than other in ear headphones. Still have to adjust them after a while, but MUCH better what I've had to go through in the past. Bluetooth is great, so no chords. And seemingly secure, although haven't done extensive running with them in yet.Cons: with using the squishy ear attachments the sound quality drops a little since i assume they're more for bass quality and they sometimes try to push out of the ear if you don't ne secure them well enough. Still some discomfort after a while around the ear, but everyone different. If you can secure the wire around the head so it doesn't bounce while you run them that would be better too.Using it for music, movies, and YouTube on your phone is really good overall. Phone quality isn't bad either. I hear them perfectly, only has one person say they couldn't hear me talking while using Bluetooth.Overall: try them out, give them a chance. They're not expensive and can really surprise you. I'm definitely content with my purchase.","positive"
"Beyond great in every possible way.","This was a decent product until it died after 2 and a half months. The sound was great, the battery life was great and the headphones stayed on without any problems. I was very happy with what I had ordered until I went to use them one morning and they were dead. I tried  changing them but had no luck. Maybe I just got a bad set, I think this is a reasonably product and I wouldn't tell anyone not to buy them even after my bad experience.  The 1 star is for the pair I received only.Update on my review.I am changing my review to 5 stars. I was completely blown away by the amazing way this company have treated me. I was sent a replacement set of headphones to replace the defective set I had bought a few months earlier. I did not even have to ask. I can't think of a time I have ever received such good service and been made feel like I am truly valued as a customer. Thank you so much and I will recommend this company to everyone and will be the only place I buy headphones in the future. A true shining example to other companies. Simply wonderful.","positive"
"It talks to you!","My previous headset had various beeps that were supposed to tell me what the state was. I wasn't able to be sure at any point exactly what was going on.  This one tells me if it is on, off and connected.  I also discovered that if I leave it on for quite a while without playing anything, it reminds me that it is still on! How cool is that? And so far, the battery is working as advertised, the sound is good enough and so forth.  Whoever designed this deserves a pat on the back.I do wish the ear pieces that go around the back of the ear  were a little less flexible and held the pods in place better. But that's a relatively minor quibble. Good product for the price.","positive"
"Terrible Connection to phone.","I use these a lot when working out, mowing the lawn. The sound quality is great, they are very loud and block out a lot of noise, lots of bass too. However the most annoying thing is how often it disconnects if i'm listening to things off Youtube, pandora, anything. It just automatically disconnects at the most random times. Super annoying. Sometimes it is connected but still 'beep's as though its looking for a connection while stuff is playing through the earphones. Lastly, when the battery is low it beeps and says low battery for the longest time. It disrupts what you're listening to until it turns off.","negative"
"Amazing sound and quality! very happy","I have a very expensive wireless head set which I forgot to bring with me. This one is 1/4 the price and better quality and sound. I'm very impressed. It also comes with several back up speaker sound covers that go in your ear. This is great too. Although they seem like they will never fall off I lost one with my expensive set and it had no back ups and the head phones were useless. The Mpow flame has very clear and accurate sound and impressive base response. If you have a good ear you will love these.","positive"
"Good sound","I like this headphone. Good sound and battery power. I hear it from a good distance although I can’t pretend to know how far.","positive"
"Happy purchase","Very happy with the purchase. It connects effortlessly and the sound quality is pretty good.","positive"
"Great earbuds!","I've always hated earbuds because they never stay in my small ears. These work great, and while they can still be loose, they work better than any earbuds I've used before! I can actually work out with them and the sound quality isn't bad. Overall a great buy!","positive"
"They work great and easy to connect to any device","They work great and easy to connect to any device, only complaint was the case had a shoe print on it. I bought it new yet in the package there was an obvious shoe print on it, I don't think they were new but I was going on a trip so I kept them. They do work great regardless, the case is strong enough to get stepped on and protect the contents so that's good to know.","positive"
"Good quality for the price","I originally returned these headphones since the bluetooth kept cutting out but the seller sent me a new pair even without me asking for one. The new pair does work better and I'm impressed with the service of the seller. These headphones are great for the price point and I'm happy with the overall quality.","positive"
"Three Stars","Didn't last long, maybe four months. But neither did the last wireless ones we got.","negative"

"Great Headphones!!","These headphones are perfect. I wear headphones when working out a lot and it's so easy to have wireless headphones. My brother convinced me to get them, (he has the same one) and it truly is well worth the price!! If you are thinking about buying beats, consider these instead. I would like a different color though.","positive"
"I received a replacement for defective headphones. The new headphones work fine. Thanks!","I purchased this set of headphones based on pricing and reviews.  The first time I used it, the sky was overcast, and the signal was very broken and intermittent.  It was so annoying I took them off during my run.  I went out today to run, and the result was the same.  However the skies couldn't have been more clear.  I went back in my house and got my older set of headphones, and they worked perfectly.  No static, broken reception at all.  Mpow is a very disappointing product.  Returning them to Amazon today for a credit.","negative"
"Worth $20","Pros:Super cheap. The sound quality is good, not great but honestly better than I expected for the price. I've never had any trouble with these falling out of my ears. Ability to play/pause/skip and change volume on the earbuds is a huge plus. Good battery life for the day. Pairing is super easy.Cons: They do come with a built in mic but I didn't have a great experience with them. Fairly bulky and noticeable. People on the other end of the call tend to have trouble hearing me. Got a little sweaty along the back of my ears but wasn't a huge issue.I would recommend them if you're looking for cheap earbuds for casual music/podcasts/etc (ie not phone calls).","positive"
"good headphones for the price, support replaced dead headphones no questions asked","It was a great product till it died yesterday. Used it in gym few times a week, was very careful with it. Don't know if sweat killed it or just the product was defective. Anyway, there are plenty reviews like mine for this headphones, so it doesn't look like an isolated issueEDIT: when I posted my review, support from Patozon store contacted me and offered a replacement. I've received the replacement shortly via USPS and it's working great (for now). I also should mention that when I was waiting for the replacement I was using Anker Soundcore Arc headphones, which are twice more expensive, and comparing to Mpow Flame they are also a lot quiter and produce less bass. Also, Anker doesn't hold in my ears as good and fell off often. Overall, I would still recommend buying Mpow because of the good sound quality for such price, and great support. I hope these headphones will last longer than the previous ones.","positive"
"Definitely Recommend","I've had this for a little over two weeks with moderate use just to make sure I got a feel for it and nothing went wrong with it. In that time period, my expectations have been exceeded with these pair of headphones. For such a small pair of headphones, they give such a kick. The bass is powerful and pumps me for working out. The handling of the headphones like the controls and inserting in ears were tricky, but just need some time to get used to. I'd recommend these headphones for anyone looking for powerful headphones without breaking the bank.","positive"
"If you like beats, these are great. Otherwise...","My initial review was negative and I still feel the Mpow Flame's arent all that great. Howeer amazon customer service is so superb that they sent me out a new headset the Mpow Cheetah.These so much better than the flame. They cost like $2 more and have much nicer balanced sound. The sound is clear but not tinny and there is a good amount of bass to compliment it. Also the build qaulity is very sturdy. Overall great headphones, cant recommend the cheetah's enough!","positive"
"Randomly stopped working after normal use","I'm not one to abuse my headset devices; I do my best to not tug on the cords or make them come in contact with substances that could harm them. However, this headset decided to die after a session of normal use. I was listening to music for roughly 4 hrs then plugged the headset into its dongle on top of my desk after I was done. The next day I took the headset out of its dongle for another routine music session and it just wouldn't turn on. I pressed the button to turn it on and got nothing. I checked to see if it was a lack of charge on the battery, but the lights didn't turn on like they normally do when charging. Its a shame that I have to give this product only 2 stars because it actually has good sound and battery life for the price point. I've had this headset only since June 21st of this year and am really disappointed it's decided to quit on me so soon. I was going to order another one of these but the short life span and light use of this one has made me reconsider.UPDATE: The seller sent me a replacement headset and they're working very well so far. great customer service. If I run into any problems I'll post them in this review.","negative"
"Pretty Good","Bought these for work over the Mpow Jaws for a replacement. The quality of sound is pretty good in terms of audio. However, my phone being in my back pocket, i would lose audio clarity from time to time. This didnt happen with my other model.Battery life is pretty good as well, not as good as the Jaws model however. Provides about 10 hours of high use play. Maybe 11 if under stop and go use.The one real problem personally for me is the inability to wear one earbud at a time. The earbuds are quite durable, as my job demands. But the design leads to one ear bud pulling out the other. Slight oversight on my part, but inconvenient to adjust every few minutes. Still pretty good overall tho","positive"
"Best headphones I've ever bought, hands down.","My second purchase of these, and probably won't be the last. These headphones are what I dreamed of as a teenager. Cord-free, great sound, and ridiculously comfortable. I use these at the gym, when I'm moving stuff around the house or cleaning (33ft range is awesome), or simply using the default bluetooth for driving or when I'm hiding and making phone calls at work. Bottom line is that these are just plain great headphones. I have one of their gaming headsets, too. It's quality like these headphones. and has great sound quality to boot. I rarely get wow'd by the cheaper alternatives to name-brand electronics and gaming peripherals, but I think these dudes really nailed it with their brand.","positive"
"good sound, charged quickly","Bought headphone less than a month ago. For a while they worked well, good sound, charged quickly, etc. Yesterday they suddenly turned off. I thought maybe the charge had been depleted, but I hooked up the usb cord and the charge light would not come on. I left the usb cord in for an hour, but it would not turn on. Reaching out to the company to see what they recommend.4/18/18, Update. The seller reached out to me and offered to send a replacement which I received a few days later. It's only been 5 days, but so far the replacement headphones work great. Kudos to their customer service.","positive"
"Good budget buy","So far so good- purchased these after I lost my trusty headphones that were an expensive brand name- I have used them a total of 8 hours in the gym and have not have to charge them yet. Seem to be holding up to sweat well. They feel really light on your ear and having 3 ear bud sizes to choose from is really nice as I needed the smallest size (a lot of brands send you too). Feel really secure during running and jumping, and sound is clear as Long as phone is within 10-12 feet. I noticed that Once you get farther than that there can be a little disruption in the sound). Hopefully they hold up a while as they are a good deal","positive"
"I received a replacement for defective headphones. The new headphones work fine. Thanks!","I purchased this set of headphones based on pricing and reviews.  The first time I used it, the sky was overcast, and the signal was very broken and intermittent.  It was so annoying I took them off during my run.  I went out today to run, and the result was the same.  However the skies couldn't have been more clear.  I went back in my house and got my older set of headphones, and they worked perfectly.  No static, broken reception at all.  Mpow is a very disappointing product.  Returning them to Amazon today for a credit.","neutral"
"Worth $20","Pros:Super cheap. The sound quality is good, not great but honestly better than I expected for the price. I've never had any trouble with these falling out of my ears. Ability to play/pause/skip and change volume on the earbuds is a huge plus. Good battery life for the day. Pairing is super easy.Cons: They do come with a built in mic but I didn't have a great experience with them. Fairly bulky and noticeable. People on the other end of the call tend to have trouble hearing me. Got a little sweaty along the back of my ears but wasn't a huge issue.I would recommend them if you're looking for cheap earbuds for casual music/podcasts/etc (ie not phone calls).","positive"
"good headphones for the price, support replaced dead headphones no questions asked","It was a great product till it died yesterday. Used it in gym few times a week, was very careful with it. Don't know if sweat killed it or just the product was defective. Anyway, there are plenty reviews like mine for this headphones, so it doesn't look like an isolated issueEDIT: when I posted my review, support from Patozon store contacted me and offered a replacement. I've received the replacement shortly via USPS and it's working great (for now). I also should mention that when I was waiting for the replacement I was using Anker Soundcore Arc headphones, which are twice more expensive, and comparing to Mpow Flame they are also a lot quiter and produce less bass. Also, Anker doesn't hold in my ears as good and fell off often. Overall, I would still recommend buying Mpow because of the good sound quality for such price, and great support. I hope these headphones will last longer than the previous ones.","neutral"

"I don’t recommend these earbuds but I do recommend Mpow Cheetah","The headphones are durable however the earbuds themselves are way too big and they fall out of my ears all the time. And I don’t believe they can be replaced with smaller ones as they don’t seem to detach. I don’t recommend these earbuds unless you are comfortable will a larger fit.Edit: The seller had contacted me after this review and sent me the Mpow Cheetah to try. I have raised this review from a three star to a four star because the sellers willingness to to make their customers happy. I am happy to report that the Mpow Cheetah has surpassed my expectations. It has smaller buds that you can switch out, great sound quality, three times longer battery life, and it fits my head perfectly with glasses on. If you don’t like this product I would definitely recommend trying Mpow Cheetah instead!","negative"
"These are just the same as having a pair of Beats headphones!","I have been waiting to replace my Beats headphones but not at the Beats price. I would definitely say that these headphones are the perfect match. The bluetooth was simple to figure out without the instructions and the sound is perfect. They even came with different ear pieces for your comfort. So far i have worked out with them about 3 times and they never fail to impress. The noise cancellation helps me concentrate on what im doing rather than the guy that slams the weight after every set! The sound is crisp and clear just like my old Beats. If anything were to happen to these I would 10 of 10 buy another pair of these the same day. I will be recommending these to all my friends. Thank you.","positive"
"Comfortable and long listening time.","These are awesome.  Description says 7 hours play time and some reviewers say 7 - 9 hours.  I was able to get 8 hours of listening with mine.  I'm sure volume has a role in how long the battery lasts.  I played at low volume so I could hear noises around me.  I've taken only one call while wearing them and the other person could hear me just fine even with the mic situated on the right earbud.  Excellent product.  I would definitely recommend these if you are looking for bluetooth earbuds.","positive"
"Won't last more than a couple months","I've only had these for 3 months. I don't use them every day, and didn't use them at all in the month of August. They now will not charge at all. Not sure what happened here; stored them in the provided case and other than a bit of sweat did not expose them to moisture.","negative"
"EDIT: what an amazing service:)","EDIT: So they actually resent a new one and I wanted to check it out before I edited the review. I never had such amazing service, let alone receive a new one from ANYWHERE even when I didn't even ask for it! I've changed from 1 star to 5 stars because of their amazing and generous effort to make things right. I  would give 10 stars if I could.OLD: These earphones arrived on Sunday and I used it for the first time while I was running on a treadmill. I wasn't even running that hard (5.5 mi/hr) and all of a sudden the right side started to make sound as if a part has broken inside the earbud. It'll just bounce in the earbud and make the most annoying sound right in my right ear. I'm actually writing this review as I'm cooling down because it was SO annoying. This was supposedly made for working out, but it can't even handle mild jogging on a treadmill... what a disappointment.","positive"
"the sound quality is very nice too, its sporty and fancy","Been using the above product for a while.Pros - Its cheap, the sound quality is very nice too , its sporty and fancy, battery life is good,comfortable to wear,  charging is quick, packaging is very good with a small headset bag to keep it safe also a insurance provided with a guarantee for 2 years just for 2 dollars something Overall a good deal.Cons - Well  i use the Mpow Flame for workout,  so sometimes the wire can get stuck on the back of the neck cause your body gets sweaty a bit when you workout. I had kind of a clip for the wire but it got lost cause its not very strong, also while running  one ear set can become lose and then you gotta press it back to your ear.To conclude - Its overall a good product for everyday use.Just bought Mpow Jaws.. I love it compared to flame... Will soon write a review for the same.","positive"
"It's very comfortable and the volume and sound quality are excellent","It's very comfortable and the volume and sound quality are excellent. I haven't had cause to test the water resistance but the battery life leaves nothing to be desired. My least favorite thing is probably the delay when I answer a call. There's almost 2 to 3 seconds where I'm saying 'hello' before the other party gets connected. That never happens with wired headsets. That's a minor gripe though and easily overlooked. I also have to mention the range is great. I'm usually close to my phone, but when I'm not there's no drop off in quality. And, these things were only $20. More than value for money.","positive"
"Bluetooth great, sound great, price great. Amazon gets to you quick.","First off delivery was amazing ordered late Thursday arrived Saturday morning. The earbuds came in a perfect little carrying case, charging cord all beautiful packaged and bubble wrapped. I took out of the packaging and they were fully charged and connected with one simple click after I connected the Bluetooth with one click, from out of the box I was listening to music with 15 seconds. I listened to Spotify and Sirius apps and the sound quality is perfect, loud and clear. Just now I put on some song with harmonies and layers and the clarity and separation is great. You can hear the separation between right, left ears the way the music was intended - extremely high quality. This is the second time i bought mpow - I also am a big fan of the full sized, noise canceling headphones, so I took the chance. With mpow you are looking at sound quality a small notch below the headphones that cost 5 times the amount like Bose. This is the first time using earbuds with that hook around my ear, and this really pays off in terms of the buds firmly in the correct spot in your ears and making the sound quality even more consistent. These headphones with the awesome hard shell case should keep these buds in great shape for as long as I have them. Great purchase for only $20 - feels like $60 quality minimum. Can’t go wrong Mpow is trying to do everything the right way as far as I can see.","positive"
"Good price/great sound/very comfortable","I was hesitant to order these at first because of the low price. The reviews by others I’ve read on other sites persuaded me. And I wasn’t going to be out much money if I didn’t like them anyway. After using them though I’m very greatful that I did. The sound is absolutely great and they are incredibly comfortable. I use them while lifting or running and even doing yard work. I don’t have issues with them falling out and I noticed that they do a great job blocking out other sounds. Not completely noise canceling but they do a pretty decent job. I highly recommend them.","positive"
"VERY good purchase if looking to get some Bluetooth headphones","I bought these headphones a few days before a trip to bring with me as I needed a good reliable pair of Bluetooth headphones. At first I was somewhat weary due to the reviews - some people reported that they would just stop working all together after a few days, and since I would have needed them to last me at least until I got back from my trip to do anything to fix them, I was nervous, I'll admit. However, it has now been around 2 weeks since I purchased these headphones and they're still working great! Absolutely no technical errors so far, the sound quality is amazing, maybe not 100% sound canceling since they are earbuds and not headphones, but they're at least 95%, and the battery life is extremely resilient (I still have yet to run it down all the way - not to say I haven't charged them after using them for a few hours a day though)! I absolutely recommend this product and if, after purchasing, for whatever reason you do have an issue or technical complaint about these earbuds, the support team is very hands-on and one of the best I've ever seen.When I first received this product I had my family try it out too, and my mother who has a pair of Bluetooth headphones as well (different brand) commented that she actually felt like these were better than the ones she had gotten (and for a much better price as well).","positive"
"The sound is good but what's the use of them if they do ...","The round shaped plastic pieces that hold the headphones on the ears are too flexible.When I run, the headphones are shaking and they are not staying still on the ears.Also, when you move you head (neck) left and right for stretching, again, they tend to fall out.With the cord around your neck, the headphones won't fall down to the ground but still not very convenient.The sound is good but what's the use of them if they do not stay in ears?Update (6/8/18) : The company reached me first and offered to send me a newer version of the headphones.This one does not have the ear holding plastic pieces.However, two ear pieces are designed to attract each other to have the unit to stay on the head in-ears.I love this product.It does not slip down but very much stay on.Thank you.","neutral"
"Great pair of earbuds with clear audio, tangle-free cord, and comfortable ear hooks!","This is my fifth pair of BT earbuds I've ordered, trying to find a satisfactory pair that worked with an online videoconferencing application (Zoom). This is what I like about them:1. No one complained about not being able to hear me during our video chat.2. They are comfortable.3. The flexible ear hooks help hold the earbud in place.4. The cord is a flat, quarter-inch thick cord so it doesn't get tangled easily.5. They connected easily to my laptop's BT.","positive"
"Perfect for working out!","I bought these with the main use for working out at the gym and jogging.  I got tired of my old wired earbuds either falling out because I was sweating or the wire would get in the way.  These sound great!  I was very impressed.  I haven't charged them once since I received them in the mail and have used them 4 different times now for about an hour each time.  So far, I'm extremely happy with my purchase and definitely recommend :-)","positive"
"I bought this and it was working fine until six months in.","I bought this and it was working fine, although it states that it lasts 7-9 hours, I was getting closer to 6 hours. Although the headphones would say there was 10% battery left it would shut off, and a few minutes prior to that it would constantly say battery low while your music was playing. That's not the big complaint I have though I could deal with that the issue I have is I bought this near the end of November 2017, and now in June 2018 (right around 6 months) the headphones no longer charge. I have plugged it into various usb cords and outlets none of them are charging the headphones.7/2/18 update the customer service group is very friendly and proactive. They reviewed my comment and messaged me asking if they could send me a new pair as a replacement. So far the replacement has been working unsure if the battery life is the promoted 7-9 hours as I charge mine about every 2-3 uses to make sure it never dies on me during a workout. I will place another review around the 6 month mark to see if it lasts longer.","neutral"
"Won’t stays connect to my phone","UPDATE: After I wrote the original review the company contacted me and sent me a new pair of headphones. I wanted to wait a month or so before I gave a update on how they worked just to be sure. So far they have been working great. I haven't had any problems with them connecting or going in and out while listening to music. The original pair I got must have just been faulty which happens so it's not a big deal. It was nice that the company reached out to me and replaced the bad pair. 4.5 starsI bought these headphones about 2 months ago and at first they worked really well. I was actually surprised that they stayed in my ears whenever I ran. I’m giving it a 2 star rating though because for the past month they haven’t been connecting to my phone via Bluetooth. At first I thought it was just bad connection with my phone because it only happened every no and again but now it disconnects with my phone every 5 minutes or so and it doesn’t want to reconnect. It will take me 5 or more minutes just to reconnect it to my phone because it keeps saying the headset is out of range even though they are right next to my phone. I read all the reviews before buying mine and they sounded good so maybe I just got a faulty pair I don’t know.","negative"
"Lightweight and convenient.","Light weight, easy to use and to sync with my iPhone. After checking out the first set, I purchased a second set for my daughter. Comes with a charging cord and different sized ear buds.The only downside is that the smallest earbud is a bit large for my ears, but I have that problem with all earbuds; also, I have to disconnect my iPhone charging cord to be able to charge the headphones as they don’t come with a plug charging adapter.","positive"
"Great sound/bass, build quality, and customer service","I love the headphones so far. The first pair I had we're excellent, however, they did seem to die prematurely which lead me to believe the battery may have been bad. The wonderful customer service got in contact with me to ask me how I was enjoying the product which I replied it was great but the battery seemed to die sooner than advertised. They sent out another pair for free for me and they have been perfect so far. Very happy with the product and the company.","positive"
"Excellent for the price; great sound","There are a number of products with this particular design:  Over-the-ear hook for stability, cable to connect both pieces to sync the sound (earbuds that are two separate units may suffer from this problem), buttons to operate various functions... What makes this one better is that the sound quality is awesome for the price.  I use these for running, so sweatproof/waterproof is a big plus (no, I have not tried submerging them).  If they last a year, that would be a miracle, so it's important that I don't spend a lot of money on these things, but a run is made all the more miserable if you don't have music.  The microphone is in the right earpiece, which doesn't pick up your voice too well, but if I hang the hook on my collar, it's fine (the sound quality would improve if you hold the earpiece in front of your mouth, which is annoying for long phone calls).  The ONLY complaint that I have is that the cable is a little stiff, which makes winding it up to put in the case a more tedious task than it needs to be.  Solution:  Change the case.","positive"
"People always say I sound muffled (when I connect them ...","My first pair: People always say I sound muffled (when I connect them to my phone mid call it takes forever to link the two)My replacement pair: The new pair looks better, fits my ears much much better, and sounds wonderful! However, there is some issue with pairing to my device still it may take a few tries (4-5) to get connected but thereafter it seems to be worth the wait.","neutral"
"... for the reason to eliminate the cord from my smart phone while walking and working out","I ordered two sets of these mainly for the reason to eliminate the cord from my smart phone while walking and working out.  I rated them a four only because of the short time which I've had them.  The longer I have them, the more I like them.  The ear pieces which were installed on the units were slightly large for me, I switched them to the smaller size and that was a good thing.  My main use of these is music listening while exercising and they have worked very well for the short time I have had them.","positive"
"Very nice.","They sound a bit flatter than the ipod earbuds but they work great. I mostly listen to audiobooks and when i turn them on i can open the book without touching the phone. Very convenient and nice.","positive"
"Shockingly good headphones for $20","Shockingly good headphones for $20. I'm about to buy a second pair incase they stop selling for whatever reason. Sound quality is excellent, build quality is above excellent for this price point, they even fit into my oddly shaped ears where no other ear canal type design has before. they stay in place, sound great, last a good chunk of time... and they were $20! Can't go wrong with these.","positive"
"Now the third replacement has stopped working after about a month. It won't recharge. No red or green lights.","This item was received on time. Packaging looked fine, i.e. not damaged. Apparently charged initially but after a couple of uses, sound would break up. After that, it no longer charged. I sent a comment to the seller but received no response in the last three days. Therefore, to let other potential buyers know their risk, I submitted this review. It could be a bad recharging connection, don't know. The bottom line is that I bought it, got it and within two weeks it doesn't work at all. Very disappointing because it worked fine with my ipod initially.The seller sent a replacement and was cordial. However, after less than 10 uses, the replacement no longer works......","negative"
"Thank you Mpow","I love turning on my computer in the morning, opening up a music folder and listening to my collections of favorite songs with this Bluetooth headphone while I prepare breakfast and get my day started. Music makes mornings better. I don't have to carry around or transfer files to and from my MP3 player anymore. It wasn't that it was much of a chore, but it's just more convenient. The headphones are comfortable, well priced, and sound good.","positive"
"Great headphones for exercising","These work really well. The hooks are a little big, but maybe I just have small ears. I've worn them hiking and running and haven't had an issue with them falling off. I like the different sized earbuds that come with them and the sound quality is very good. I had no trouble connecting them to my phone. They are so much better than trying to run with non-bluetooth headphones. I've also tried the TaoTronics bluetooth headphones and like these better. The cord is shorter on the Mpow ones and they don't fall off your ears like the TaoTronic ones.","positive"
"so the lightning to headphone adapter is no good for the port on the battery case","Bought 2 of these after upgrading my wife's and son's phone to the iphone8. We also put on battery cases, so the lightning to headphone adapter is no good for the port on the battery case, so needed bluetooth headphones. There's really so many different brands and varieties of these out there, that I was particular of buying ones that had good reviews. So far the sound quality is decent for the price, and both family members are happy.","positive"
"excellent customer service raise headphones to acceptable","given that the instruction are the barest and given in pictograms, the terrible puzzle of pairing is unnecessarily time consuming. not everyone is privy to the unique craziness of the process. a simple paragraph or FAQ IN ENGLISH, in the box, would save everyone a whole lot of hassle. the material construction is good. the sound is like listening to a $15-$20 headset. customer service is quite good and saves the day.","positive"
"I'm SO happy that I kept them","I wasn't sure if I was going to use them. I even wanted to return them but I decided to just give them a try. I'm SO happy that I kept them. They're awesome! I love to use them to calm and relax my mind  at night so I can sleep. Hands down, they're well worth the money I. I love the quality and no irritating wires to untangle and the sound is impressive. Easy Pairing, and great to talk on too. They're comfortable great looking. I would highly recommend these if you're looking for a great pair of Bluetooth Earbuds. You can't go wrong!","positive"
"Great headphones!","These are a great quality product for the price!  Great sound quality, I wear them pretty much every day when I go for walks or at the gym.  I tend to sweat a lot, and I've never had a problem.  I didn't even realize these were noise cancelling, guess that's why I never really hear anyone when I wear them...  So yeah, that part works really well, too!  I've never worn the battery completely down, but I don't think, I've worn them more than 3 hours at a time.  Pretty comfy, the controls are easy to find and use.  I have about 7 different headphones, and these are by far my favorites, and very close to some $150 and $350 noise cancelling headphones I've heard, and they were headphones that completely cover the ears.  I would definitely recommend these for anyone - or should I say everyone!","positive"
"Good Value for the money","Product arrived within the promised time frame. These headphones work with my (cheap) android phone and allow me to listen to music without the hassle of a connecting wire. The range seems to top out at about 10 feet, so I can leave the phone on the counter while doing dishes and still listen to music. I haven't had the chance to use them as a phone headset (i.e. incoming calls) and will update this review as necessary once I do. I would buy this item again if I need another pair.","positive"
"Original died and they sent me a new pair promptly","UPDATE: Within a day or so of posting my original review, the seller contacted me directly and offered to send a replacement pair free of charge. They arrived and work perfectly. I am very pleased with the level of customer service provided to salvage the experience.These were good headphones with good battery life but they started buzzing during a sweaty workout and cutting in and out and then totally shut off. I thought they might have died without my hearing the multiple “battery low” alerts, but the light wouldn’t even come on when I tried to charge them. This is ridiculous. One should be able to sweat in Bluetooth headphones without them crapping out.","positive"
"Alright but certainly room for improvement.","Alright headphones. If you are on a budget these are priced at an outstanding value. However, you are paying for the case, extra pieces, and nice packaging. The sound quality on these is — at best — 4/10. Bass distorts sound quality at mid-volume usage. I suppose if you are listening to classical these would be perfect. However, most songs that are produced now adays have some degree of bass to them.Again, affordable but not my first recommendation.","neutral"
"Battery Life","Adjustability is minimal and does not necessarily fit each individuals ear and other brands can collapse or slide to fit snugly. However, ear piece seems to stay in place so I can complain much. For the price I would suggest the purchase. The primary reason for my purchase was due to the stated 7-9 hour battery life in play mode. I've had others last less than 2, so I jumped at this one. While although still new, I've been able to have them play and last a couple of 8 hour shifts, that's what I needed.","negative"
"Low cost and perfect for what I wanted them for","I bought this headset so I can have hands-free phone/voice chat conversations when I'm active or gaming. So far they've worked very well; they're compact, come with a fairly sturdy case that keeps them safe when I take them in my work bag, have a fantastic range, and last a while between charges. And considering they cost little more than a pair of wired headphones of the same quality, I'm pretty thrilled with them.","positive"
"Good Customer Service","06/29/18: I've been given a pair of Mpow Cheetah headphones in replacement of the Flames in response to the review below. The Cheetahs are good so far: they fit better, but have harsher sound compared to the Flames. I've upgraded my rating to show thanks to customer service, but this doesn't change anything about the Flames' previous performance.06/24/18: Had two sets of these headphones die in four months due to battery and Bluetooth module problems, respectively. The headphones' sound and fit was decent when it worked, and the Mpow folks were quick to send a replacement set while this was under warranty. Still, it's not worth exercising that warranty over and over to accommodate trash engineering. Buy something else.","positive"
"Don't be fooled by low price!  Great headphones!","Ordered as a replacement to Plantronics back beats which I recently lost.  Couldn't justify $100+ on a new pair, so thought I'd try these.I was a bit skeptical based on lower price point, but these are amazing headphones!  They stay in place while working out and the memory foam ear pieces do a better job of keeping out sweat than the more expensive back beats!It took me a few times to get used to the cord resting on the back of my neck, which is the only feature I like better on the Plantronics brand, but once I got used to it, it's no problem whatsoever!","positive"
"Great for music, worthless for talking on the phone.","Thought I was getting a great deal. Sound qaulity is premium, but when I tried talking on the phone with this earpiece the other party could barely hear me and I had to switch back to my phone.  Great gear for listening, not for talking.UPDATE 3-20-2018I was contacted by the company and sent a free pair of mpow cheetahs. I have yet to use them, but the customer service is five stars. The Cheetahs seem higher quality and less bulky so I would maybe recommend them.","neutral"
"Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.","After growing sick and tired of having my earbuds ripped from my ears because the wire caught on something or having to bother with neatly storing the wired earbuds else they become a tangled mess, I wanted wireless. These are perfect for my uses and I appreciate the easily accessible volume and off/on controls. They were easy to sync with my iPhone, the clarity is very good, and they hold a charge for hours.","positive"
"Great sound. Great product service","Initially product worked fine, but with in 2 months some of the functions, such of volume control quit working. Now less than 6 months since purchase device no longer charges and is useless. I guess you get what you pay for.Update: Upon initial review I had given 2 stars, but after review the company sent me a new set immediately. Customer service is great and they stand behind product. I changed review to 4 stars.","positive"
"Great if they fit","Bought to use with my new apple watch 3. Worked great and paired fast with my watch, the sound quality was great. However, the headphone itself was just too big for my small ears. They were really bulky and wouldn't even fit completely on my ear, leaving a huge gap in between and loose in my ear. If they fit properly I would have kept them, but sadly had to return to find a pair that would fit my ears properly.","positive"
"Great value.","Very pleased so far.  Had some doubt about the ear hooks, but found them very comfortable.  They also prevent the ear piece from falling out.  this was a constant problem with my other pair which are the ear insert type.  Maybe I have weird ears,  The stated battery life appears to be accurate as well.  This was another problem with my other earphones, they only have a battery life of 2 -3 hrs which is much less than the stated battery life of 4 - 5 hrs","positive"
"was happy the first day i got it * REVISED REVIEW**","was happy the first day i got it. I usually don't like anything in  my ear and this was surprisingly comfortable, however only after 2 uses it stopped working. very disappointed and a waste of money.*******************************************************I am updating my review to 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️After leaving my review the company reached out to me letting my know a replacement one was on its way and apologized. I was very impressed with there  customer service and it was nice not have any for me to reach out and request a new one or refund. Within two days I received the new Bluetooth and it has been working great ever sence.  I am very happy with the product as the second one they sent me has not failed. Or use it every day and I have not had any issues with it! Happy with the product and very happy with the customer service, will buy from them again!","positive"
"Great lil headset, compares to beats by Dre very closely.","Very pleased with my purchase. I use these at work as a mechanic so I can listen to my music and zone out in my jobs and not upset others that don't share my taste in music. They're loud, plenty loud to mask the sounds of air impact guns, air hammer and grinders. I use these for 8+hrs straight with random pausing to talk with a co-worker or test drive to hear noises cars make.Have been using daily for almost a week before, during and after work and all weekend so far with nightly charging. Very comfortable to wear, sound is directional into ear, can be worn with buds not inserted, others don't hear my music compared to my last Bluetooth headsets that still work fine, just wanted more comfortable and bass.Very very pleased for all my rap and rock needsAlso callers hear me perfectly fine over other headsets I've used.","positive"
"So I'd say they have average volume but get loud enough pretty good bass","Charged up fully the day I got them. Ran a 5k two days later. They didn't cut out/shut off or act up at all. I do wish they were louder. I don't have many pairs of bluetooth experience under my belt to compare them to.... So I'd say they have average volume but get loud enough pretty good bass. They paired up fine, did have a slight connection issue once but paired fine when tried a second time. For the price they're great would buy again if needed to!","positive"
"They made good on the warranty.","Sound was okay, connected quickly to my phone during workouts.  Bought it on Feb 24 and the other day May 2 it just stopped in the middle of my workout.  It just stopped.  Tried charging it and nothing.  It's dead.  Amazon warranty has expired.  Mpow warranty process is ridiculous.....if you can even find it on their website.  Because I bought it through Amazon, of course it's way more complicated....that is if they ever even respond to my email asking for a replacement.Updating my review.  Once I finally got a hold of them, they did send a replacement pair pretty quickly.  Seem to work fine right now....hopefully they last this time around.","positive"
"Stays in, doesn't yank out, great battery life, and surprisingly good audio for gym headphones.","For the price, an excellent buy. I have not yet used them enough to see if the waterproofing is real - cheap headphones have a habit of shocking you in the ears mid-run once the sweat is everywhere. The three silicone earplugs and the one rubber sealing one were nice to find.Comes in a nice case with a charger and the extra plugs. Battery capacity is great, a good two hours of running didn't kill them. Sound is more than good enough for a set of gym headphones. With the rubber plugs, surprisingly good bass and quality.My last set would announce Battery Low every 5 seconds when it was low, this one's once a minute. Will not be yanked out of your ears, will not be in the way at all. Only a slight bit uncomfortable after long wear - but if your workout is lasting long enough to get in the way, you're either a marathoner or a total gymrat. My only gripes are having to hold the Next button so long to change the song and no way to activate voice control.","neutral"
"Flame=Fave!","I've tried many bluetooth stereo headsets from Bose to everything Plantronics makes and many off brand products. The Flame is one of the best. Awesome volume, bass, battery life and the form factor is perfect. Time will tell in the durability area. One thing I have on my wish list is simultaneous connection to more than one device at a time. You can pair it with at least two (I haven't tried a third). But you cannot connect to more than one at a time.","positive"
"Nice overall but the battery is awful.","Overall they’re nice for the price, BUT the battery life is terrible. It was fine initaiallg but it’s become awful now. I’ve fully charged mine several times and then turned them OFF after I unplugged them, then put them in the case and not touched them for a while and just a bit ago I got them out and used them and after about 10-20 minutes the voice said “battery low” but I thought maybe it just had a short or something to make it say that even when the battery is full. Then a few more minutes went by and it said it again. And again. And then it said “Power off” and crapped out on me, after about 30 or so minutes of use. These had pretty good reviews for the price so I was hopeful and needless to say I’m very disappointed with how they actually are. I’m going to give these one more overnight charge and try again and if it still sucks then I plan to return them and hopefully get my money back.","neutral"
"They’re Fiiiinnneee","I don’t usually write reviews but because of all the people bitching about a 20 dollar electronic product, I decided to.I have had them a month and they’ve worked as great as a $20 product should.Pros:They were, um $20.• Lightweight.• Charge fast.• Easy to use.• They have pretty colors.• They magically transfer music or podcasts or news or anything else from space to your head while you do Soul Cycle.• Dude! A carrying case!Cons:• I lose them all the time.• The charge dies quickly. Probably because I’d don’t turn them off.• I WISH THE VOLUME COULD GO UP ANOTHER NOTCH! DID YOU HEAR ME?• I lose them all the time. Pants pockets, backpack, my apartment. I even lost them in the case they belong in.• Yeah, sometimes the Bluetooth signal gets blocked by my fat ass, but that’s not the headphones fault.They’re fine. I’d rather buy them 10 times over  than buy some dope ass Beats earbuds and lose them. Or worse, drop them in the toilet or my bowl of pho.","neutral"
"Picks up a lot of background noise.","It picked up background noise. No one could actually hear​ me talking.","negative"
"Needs line of sight to your phone to work","I don't usually review products, but I feel I have to warn potential customers how this seems to stay connected to your phone. The bluetooth receiver is in the right-hand earbud. If I put my phone in my front left pants pocket it has a choppy connection at best. At worst, it doesn't even work. The only reliable way I've found to use this headset is with my phone in my hand, which isn't viable for me (listening to music while at the gym and/or running). I don't use a case for my phone, but I would imagine if it has trouble connecting when my phone's in my pocket, it'll have trouble connecting if I did use a case.Giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because when it DOES work the sound is really good, and it's reliable as long as my phone's out of my pocket. If that's enough functionality for you, I'd recommend it. If you're using the headset for anything that you need put your phone down for, the $20 price tag isn't worth the frustration.","positive"
"Liked the first set so well I bought another.","Excellent value.  I bought a pair of Mpow headphones not expecting a lot for the price but was surprised by the excellent sound quality.  I've used them for several hours on numerous occasions and I believe I've only run them all the way down once.  I liked the first set so well I bought another so I can keep them paired to different devices.  I will definitely buy another set when it becomes necessary.","positive"
"call quality is fantastic and the other party can here me clearly","WOW!! rich bass and mids, call quality is fantastic and the other party can here me clearly! I'm not one to rave about a product but this delivered big sound for a modest price! Ive had several others but this one is the best so far. it looks a bit geeky but who cares, I can work all day at construction and not have these things slip out. I highly recommend this. I use an android.","positive"
"The headphones look good and worked well initially however","Update: The seller contacted me and tried to make things right by sending another pair of headphones to see if they work better. I haven't checked them out yet but just the fact that the seller would go to that length to improve a customer's experience speaks volumes about their business values. I have used the headphones almost daily for the last month as my workout headphones and they have performed well. The battery lasts for at least a week of one hour sessions and charges pretty quick. The issue I was having with the audio cutting out and being distorted seems to be attributed to interference rather than the hardware itself. I noticed that it mostly occurs when I am in the kitchen listening and the microwave is on and stops being a problem when it turns off. I was mistakenly attributing the problem to a kink in the wire but after testing that out as well, that doesn't seem to be the issue.Overall, I am satisfied with the product and the company that sells it. I would recommend this to a friend.The headphones look good and worked well initially however, after a week and a half the audio starts to cut out and gets scratchy which is extremely annoying. The issue seems to be resolved when the cord is adjusted but as soon as I turn my head it cuts out again. I was hoping for these to be a good solution but it is pretty disappointing.","neutral"
"*UPDATED* The Best Customer Service","*UPDATE* 08/03/2018I am currently testing a new pair of headphones which the seller replaced free of charge.  I have updated the rating based on the responsiveness of the seller.  The customer support I have received has exceeded my expectations and is unparalleled to anything I have ever experienced in the nearly 20 years that I have been shopping online.  I really did enjoy these headphones.  They were comfortable, didn't slip out of my ears while jogging, and the sound quality was better than others I have tried at the same price point so I'm very happy to have the opportunity to try them again.  I will update in a few weeks on this new pair.These were pretty decent headphones at first.  They were a great price and try to sound wasn't tinny like in a lot of lower end headphones.  My main problem is that after owning them for about 5 weeks, one night while charging, the right side exploded and melted.","positive"
"Good sound, signal not great","Pro: sound is great. Stay in ears while active and sweating.Con: can’t turn my head away from the phone without it cutting out, and reliable range is about 5 ft only with direct line of sight. Can’t do pull ups with my phone sitting on bench because my arms cut off the signal.Before this I had a 15$ pair that worked from 40 across the gym(but I tried these to find something that stayed in my ears better). Guess I need an armband for this one.","neutral"
"Good for the price","I’ve been using these about a month now and I must say they sound good and function well. The only down side is the battery life, which fluctuates from 6-8 hours depending on the charge. If they’re run dead the battery lasts about 8 hours, if they are charged before completely dead they only last about 6 hours. Also if they are used from a distance of more than 10-20 feet the battery life drops. There is also not much of a warning before the battery dies, maybe 5 mins.","positive"
"I got this headset because it seemed like a decent Bluetooth for a reasonable price","I got this headset because it seemed like a decent Bluetooth for a reasonable price. Unfortunately I am not thrilled with my purchase.The microphone in the headset sounds really scratchy, to the point that I can't even use it even when sitting still in a quiet room.The headset will randomly lose connectivity with my phone and will pause whatever I am listening to. I have also had some issues with the audio being garbled.Last, and most annoying, you get almost no warning that the battery is going to die. I got a loud warning that the battery was low and 10 minutes later it died completely.The takeaway here is that if you just want to casually listen to music or an audiobook, and are willing to keep a very close watch on how long you have listened so you can preemptively charge, you will like this headset just fine. If these things would annoy you like they do me, you may want to choose a different headset.","positive"
"Best $20 I ever spent","Best $20 I ever spent. Sound is pretty good, not Beats headphones good of course, but good enough.My only complaint and the reason they're missing a star is because the controls are a little wonky. Skipping ahead a song or back a song is quite cumbersome. Would prefer it if there were separate controls for this, than the volume buttons working double duty. Otherwise, very satisfied with this purchase.","positive"
"Too big","I am a petite person. These do not at all fit in or around my ears. I was also very disappointed to find I need to pay $7 to ship them back!UPDATE 6/4/18: I received an unsolicited replacement for these and they were no better than the ones I returned. Not only are they STILL bulky and uncomfortable, but the wire connecting the two ear pieces is thicker and rigid, making it nearly impossible to get them to sit properly. And now I'm stuck with a pair of headphones I neither need nor want.","negative"
"2 pros 1 con","I love the sound quality and the way earpiece weaps around my ear. I love the longivity of the charge and how quickly they charge.What I don't like is the way the soft rubber fastener does not stay on the cord.Update my Bluetooth was replaced with another version of headphones from Mpow and I love them. They remain charged for just about 8 hours and the sound quality is excellent. This company is realty good and the customer service is excellent, their response time to complaints is impeccable. I'm a customer for life!","positive"
"Won't stay in ear while running -- UPDATE: replacements work!!","These sound nice, pair wonderfully, etc, but, while on a run, the right bud stays in and the left bud dangles off my ear. Very frustrating. If I I had brought my old corded buds, I would've switched them out mid-run. No matter how pleasant the other positive qualities are, the poor fit when running renders these useless for me.UPDATE: The seller sent a different pair, mpow cheetah, and they work much better. I replaced the earbud pieces with the memory foam pieces from the first pair, and the cheetahs stay in ear while running much better. I also wear sunglasses while I run and this was not a problem. Very affordable and perform well. Thanks!","positive"
"Great with Equalizer Tweaking","The bass on these tends to overbear the highs and almost muffles it. With some proper equalizer tuning, these sound amazingly clear. I took these on a 20 mile bike ride and they were quite comfortable, keeping a lot of wind noise out.Just make sure to have an equalizer on your device and you won't be disappointed with these. For $20 and some EQ tuning, you can't go wrong.","positive"
"Revised Review","The headset stopped working after using for one week. I was listening to it while at gym and suddenly it stopped. Quit. Tried charging it but looks like it is dead already. Very disappointed.I bought this product after seeing 67% 5 star reviews.Review revised on 6/29/18Patozon customer service team contacted and send me a replacement for no cost. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and is working fine so far. I am bumping up the rating from 1 to 3. I will come back in a few months and give a final review with a revised ratingI have to say .. their customer service is excellent and has a great attitude about it.","negative"
"These earphones are very easy to use","These earphones are very easy to use. All you need to do is press the button on the right(?) earphone and it'll connect to your device via bluetooth. They're not the best quality, but it's good enough. I wish it came with smaller buds because the smallest was still a little too big for my ears. It still stays on so I'm not particularly mad about it. I use them for when I go to the gym and can't be bothered with wires all over the place.","positive"
"Poor Sound Quality","Sound quality is very poor.  It has good bass, but all other ranges have a very muddy sound that makes listening unenjoyable.Everything else seems good.  It's comfortable, fits well, and seems to have decent battery life.  I'd give this a 4 or 5 star review if the sound quality was better and not muddy.  Harsh, but honestly I don't think I've used earphones that have sounded worse.  Maybe I got a defect?  If so, I'll be sure to update my review if customer service fixes the issue.  If the sound was as clear as the Panasonic $10 earphones, this would be a definite five stars.","negative"
"Great sound and stay in place as long as I have a hat on and put the strap over my head","These are great.  Would rather have had sports headphones that go over the head, but can't find any of quality at a reasonable price.  With a hat though, these work great.  I take the strap and put it over the top of my head, then the hat holds the strap in place.  Even with small ears and very sweaty, they stay in place while running.  Without the hat though, they do fall out once I'm sweating.","positive"
"These things are nice","Sound quality is surprisingly good. Battery is excellent, hasn't died yet. Pairs really easily,works well for phone calls. I got way more than I expected for the priceCons: I wish it had some way of telling you the battery level before it needs to be charged. But as I said, the battery seems to last a decent amount of time. So far at least 7 hours of continuous useI will update if problems occur","positive"
"I was won over mainly because of it supposed superior battery life (up to 7 hrs of talk time) ...","I bought this product over rival ones because of the overwhelming positive reviews.  Now, after using it for several days, I have to say it's really disappointing.  I was won over mainly because of its supposed superior battery life (up to 7 hrs of talk time) and even there it failed short, no more than 5 hours I felt.  What's even more disappointing is its inability to reduce background noise when you use it to make phone calls.  I tried to talk to a recruiter at the gym and she complained about how noisy it was, which made me look foolish and unprofessional.  If I knew it was that bad, I would never use it such a setting.  Everything else about the product works as advertised, it's comfortable to use, syncs really fast, and the like.  Overall, it was such disappointment.  However, considering its price, it works and works well.  I just need to spend more money and buy a better product.","negative"
"Teh sound quality is better than I expected for the price.","I was surprised at the quality of the sound for the price.  It's not the sound quality of high end head phones, but I'm not looking for that quality of sound when i'm using them. I like it a hot humid environment and once you get them on and seated well, they stay in while walking, gardening, and in an open Jeep on the highway.They come with different sized cushions, but its not spelled out in the instruction booklet exactly what they are for, so if I play with this I might be able to improve the sound/noise cancelling, I just haven't taken the time to do that yet.","positive"
"Great quality, great fit, great price","I love these ear buds!! They actually fit my apparently shallow ears and they don’t bounce around when I’m running. They don’t get slippery and fall out with extensive sweating (I sweat like a pig). The sound quality is excellent for exercising, and you can easily control sound, pause/play, and track advancement from the actual ear piece. Great price, too. I highly recommend to at least try out. The chord that connects them behind the neck fits/lays well, too. I’m smaller framed but I’d check measurements in case you’re unsure, as it cannot be adjusted.","positive"
"Seems to work very well","So far I am very happy with these headphones. Battery life is good, After you pair the headphones with your phone or whatever, it tells you when you cut it on that it is connected to your device. Same when you cut it off it tells you, you are disconnected from your device.Used it for several weeks now and am still happy with this device. Have had no troubles. Connects and disconnects quickly with my Galaxy s7","positive"
"Noisy background when theirs supposed to be noise canceling feature on this device.","After receiving product, my wife and I use these headphones to talk while we drive. The background noise is louder than the person talking. We used them for about a week and replaced them with a different set. I tried the music on mine and it wasn’t bad but when I tried to listen to it while mowing, it keep cutting out. Now maybe that’s the mower but I have had two other sets that didn’t do that.  Was really disappointed in this product.","negative"
"Great product for the price.","These headphones were a really great surprise when I bought them for $19.99.  They seem durable, they connected to my phone's Bluetooth with 0 setup involved, and the sound quality is very good. The only problem I have had with these is a constant quiet white noise when it is receiving, such as in between songs. However, it is not noticeable when someone is talking on the other line or music is playing.","positive"
"Super happy with these!","Ordered these headphones about a month ago and I love them! I wasn't sure if they would stay on my ears (the plastic loop is way too big for my ears and it is not adjustable), but the earbuds stay in and the very slight support from the loops works. They paired easily with my iPhone and the microphone works well for phone calls. Definitely happy with these for my gym time and dog walks!","positive"
"These are awesome because they are waterproof and have a microphone","These are awesome because they are waterproof and have a microphone. If I need to talk to someone while I am working or cleaning, I don't have to worry about it. The hours my child is sleeping and I finally get a shower, these are awesome because I can still jam out to music,, They are insanely clear, and actually stay in my ears, unlike the skullcandy buds.","positive"
"Fairly comfortable, but constant static popping noise when power on ...","Fairly comfortable, but constant static popping noise when power on without music playing.Sound quality 3.5/5.Occasional problems pairing.Slightly bulky.Will be returning mainly due to popping noise. Update: seller saw review and sent new pair.  New pair took awhile to arrive,  but popping noise is gone.  Only semi-comfortable. Earbuds start to agitate  my ear after 45 mins or so.  Quietest volume setting is still pretty loud.  Sticking with overall rating of 3/5.","neutral"
"Great battery life - absolutely awful sound quality","Great battery life - absolutely awful sound quality. It is barely OK for talk shows, but not for music. Headphones has no high frequency range - sounds like from the bottom of the barrel.Revision:Company sent me the replacement headphones. Differnt model - Cheetah. Those are actually pretty good. Much better sound quality.Solid 4 stars for the price.","positive"
"I’m never going back to the long headphones again","THESE. I am so impressed by these headphones. I work out with them, hike with them, clean the house with them. I have often orgotten to charge them, but the battery actually holds up pretty well. I’ve loved them and would highly recommend them if you want headphones that stay on, are resistant to sweat (and not just a little), and that block out other sounds.","positive"
"Work Great!","I waited on this review for a while because I really wanted to experience what these headphones will do.After this time, I am very happy with this product. I didn't even know it had a microphone...not a very good one hence the 4 stars but the function of these headphones have definitely proved their worth, especially at the gym and at work when sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours.","positive"
"Surprisingly great product","I bought these headphones thinking  hey, wouldn't  it be awesome to be able to listen to music underwater? The headphones are rated for underwater use up to 3 ft so what could go wrong? I didn't ask myself how in the world a Bluetooth signal would get through the water. These headphones, although rated for underwater, will not work while you are submerged. But thinking better about it, I don't know how they would make that possible.Putting all that aside I found these headphones to be quite nice. The sound quality is great but not exceptional and the battery life was surprisingly  good. I haven't had any problems connecting to any of my devices like other people claim to have had and in fact I can have it connect to my computer and my phone at the same time and toggle between audio just fine. Overall great product, even if you run them through the wash.","positive"
"Muffled sound, no clarity...but excellent customer service","These seem to work pretty well but the first thing you notice when trying these out is the terrible audio quality. I don't understand why so man reviews are saying it is very good...there is no treble or mid range at all, just bass, bass, and more bass. It sounds like you threw a towel over a subwoofer and plugged your phone into that. It's actually even a little difficult to hear any vocals in music because all you hear is bass and kick drum. I've never heard headphones that sound this bad. Even if you love bass (which I do), this is far too much.UPDATE: The seller, after seeing my dissatisfied review, sent me an alternative model(https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Sweatproof/dp/B013U54BFG/ref=sr_1_1) which was more to my liking, with less bass. I increased my review of this product to account for the amazing customer service from the seller. Even though I am not a fan of the product the fact that they are willing to take such great care of their customers means you can feel safe ordering from them. I'd recommend the Cheetah headphones over these.","positive"
"Good if they fit you","Sound quality is good, especially for price range. My only complaint is the fit didn't work for me. The rubber ear hook things were too big and I couldn't find a good size ear piece. I gave these to a friend as a gift and they fit him well.","positive"
"Excellent Quality BUY THEM","EXCELLENT QUALITY from the Package they come in, to the Sound Quality this head set is the Real Deal.  The Sound Quality is Excellent at All volume levels and has the Perfect amount of Base for Every type of Music. Perfect for the Gym never fall out of my ears they also come with replacement foam ear buds in different sizes. So most everyone should be able to aquire the proper fit.","positive"
"Unsatisfied with purchase","Was looking for a pair of earbuds with a better quality mic, was hoping this was it but everyone I talked to claimed the call quality was awful and static-like unless I was holding my phone next to my mouth. What's the point of wireless then? Quality for music wasn't great but wasn't the best. Not even worth the price. The piece of cord that attaches the earbuds is ridiculously long.Updated review: 9/5/2018Received a new and approved headset from the original one I had purchased, company sent it from of charge and I gotta say, they really listened to my complaint, every complaint I made in the one I had originally purchased they made sure to fix in the one they sent me as a gesture of apology. Everything about it is such an improvement. Thank you so much!Updated update: Still receive complaints that microphone makes me sound far away and muffled. At least everything else was improved. 4/5","negative"
"Fit well, sound great!","Great product! I have an MPOW back up battery that has worked great so figured the headset would be good too.  I like this headset for working out because the over ear hooks keep the ear buds in place with activity.  They are supposedly water resistant and deal with the sweat well.  Great sound, volume control and it even has a mic for my conference calls!  Comes with a carrying case for travel.  Can't beat it for the price!","positive"
"Great customer service- review updated","**Review updated**I was originally sent one and the microphone is not the best quality and people have trouble hearing me. I don't know where the microphone is even located to ensure I am speaking into the correct location.Since I gave that review, they contacted me and offered to ship me a replacement for free. The replacement works great! I am happy with the product and their genuine desire to provide excellent customer service!","positive"
"Good quality in hardware and sound","I've owned a bunch of different wireless headphones, and for the price, it's safe to say these over deliver. The sound is actually really on point, of course it's not an audiophile's dream or anything, but they cost 20$ so I just expect a rich bass and clear audio and these have it. As a caveat to this 5*, I gave this rating because the headphones do exactly what they describe, with a bit more, but of course they are not the best your money can buy. (again though 20$ c'mon) I will also note I do not use BT headphones to watch video, so I can't attest to any audio delay that is often present in cheaper headsets. My only small gripe is that there is no audio feedback when a physical button is pressed until you reach upper/lower volume limits, more just a small quality of life thing than anything too needed. Great headphones, would definitely buy again.","positive"
"Thumbs Down!","The picture shows blue faces. It is awful. In fact I never seen anything like it! It is so cheaply made. What was I thinking when I bought that junk. I never even heard of that brand.","negative"
"DON'T BUY THIS CRAIG.","This player is not only extremely noisy it doesn't play properly at all. Even if you insert a brand new DVD it skips repeatedly. I've only used it a few times but felt as though it was going to ruin my personal DVDs. I would sincerely love to return this and receive credit since I have already ordered a different player.I hope that I will receive a response from someone concerning this product.","negative"
"Disappointed","This item is a piece of garbage.  I've made many purchases from Amazon the vast majority met or exceeded expectations.The quality of the picture this player provides is terrible.  Jittery picture with a lot of snow.Save your money.","negative"
"Can't recomend this Item","This was the second Graig player we bought the first one is still working but the second one is not working.  It will pop the tray out but won't put it  back in which kind of defeats the reason for it's being  One other thing in between our two purchases they changed the remote control the one that came with the second one doesn't even look like the one they show on Craig's website.  My advice DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!'","negative"
"Didnt Wirk Out","This didnt work. Pulled it right out of the box and heard something rattling around inside. Might have been damaged in transit but I was bummed.","negative"
"Worst picture quality B&W image no color","Terrible product. Very poor picture quality and plays in black and white no color! I tried on different TVs and even tried different cables from what came with it to see if any of those were the problem. But no it's the DVD player itself that isn't working. The picture gets even worse on the second TV I tried. Not only was it in black and white and snowy the image on the screen wouldn't stay still. It kept scrolling like an old film gone bad. It's unwatchable. I paid attention to the price when I should have been paying attention to the reviews. I absolutely would NOT recommend this one.","negative"
"Don’t buy.","Every single disc new and old that i have used in this player has skipped. I use this for workout videos and I can’t even get through an hour workout without issues with the player skipping. How do they expect people to watch 2 hour movies?","negative"
"broke with hardly any use","I ordered this for a Sunday School class and I can guarantee it was only used maybe 4 times before it broke.  The tray just pops in and out constantly until you unplug it.  The return window has closed or it would go back.","negative"
"Screen size randomly changes","First I waited to long to test the unit so I can't get my money back.  Best I can do is warn others.  This unit is cheap. Cheap to buy but poorly made.  Right out of the box the menu arrow buttons on the remote would sometimes work sometimes not.  Also right out of the box the screen would randomly switch size and then switch back.  There are other problems with the product but the above should be enough to convince you to stay away.  (Craig: CRummyAnnoyingIrritatinG)","negative"
"Zero Stars if possible!","When I got this dvd I try it out right away.The thing didnt work from the begining the remote wasnt responding even with new batteries. And when I pressed the button to open the disc tray it was stock.So I just unplugged it and send it right back.","negative"

Time to return item was already expired and unable to play DVD's without remote.  May try calling company not sure if I even want to deal with it.","negative"
"PIECE OF GARBAGE——DO NOT BUY","I have bought many Craig products before and I’ve never had as much problem with those as I have with this DVD player I’ve had it for just over a month and it keeps stopping it will go back to the beginning it will freeze and you can’t play it it is horrible do not buy this machine.  I can’t even play an hour and a half video without stopping and freezing 2 to 3 times.  I know it’s not my DVD movies because they play fine on other equipment do not buy this machine","negative"
"Excessive motor noise","Player took several weeks to arrrive. When I turned it on there was excessive motor noise as the disc rotated.

"Didn't work","Unpackaged and attempted to use and right out of the box it didn't work. First off it appears that the AC adapter that comes with it doesn't actually fit into the port. And then there was no power or lights on the machine. Don't waste your time.","negative"

"barebones and a bit flimsy","it's a bit finicky there's only a power button and an open/close button which automatically starts the CD (I haven't tried it with DVDs yet). The remote works but sometimes you have to press buttons multiple times to get it to work. My biggest complaint is that there's no display so you can't see what track or minute you're at. It feels a bit flimsy and it can be inconvenient to manoeuvre but it works and I can hook it up to my stereo so it does the job.","negative"

"PIECE OF JUNK SAVE YOUR MONEY","First the door won't open so a DVD could be loaded. Pressed the button to open the door and the door would move a fraction of an inch but would not open. After continually pushing the button on the remote as well and/or the one on the unit itself it finally opened. But then it wouldn't play a DVD. After many attempts using several different DVD's it finally played for about 1 minute the first time but stopped and could not get it to play again finally got it to play a different DVD after many attempts but only for about 30 seconds. I worked with the unit for a long time thinking that the door was too tight and that it would loosen up over time but after it wouldn't play I finally gave up and contacted Amazon who contacted the supplier Billy & Sons that was yesterday afternoon and as of this evening I have not been contacted by the supplier.  Usually Craig is a good product but the one I got sure wasn't. I went to Walmart and purchased a player today from them that is working good I should have done in the first place but it is hard for my wife and I to get around. I hope that the supplier gets back to me with a return authorization. I will wait a couple of days and if I haven't heard from them I will contact Amazon again.","negative"

"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!","Ok so I paid $28.88 for this DVD player so I wasn't expecting it to last years and years however I was expecting it to last longer than 2 months. It is kept in my 3 year old twins' room and they watch about a half hour of DVD's a night before they go to bed so it is not getting a crazy amount of usage. About 2 weeks ago the screen starting blacking out for 1-2 seconds during playback. Sound would continue streaming but video would pause. Last night I went to put it on and the unit was completely frozen. We had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to even open.I called CRAIG and their reply was that it did in fact come with a 3 month warranty however they would not cover and shipping and handling charges so I would have to pay to ship it to them (NY to Florida) and include a $12 check for them to ship it back to me and turn around time is 2-3 weeks for repair. So they want me to pay $25 in shipping charges for a unit that cost me $28???!!!???I previously had a compact Memorex unit that I paid $40 for and it lasted me about 5 years. When that unit crapped out I tried to find it again but couldn't and decided to try this one. That was a mistake. I will be replacing this unit with a more reputable brand.","negative"

"Broke in 4 months","It came with a 3-month warranty and broke 4 months after I purchased it.  I chose this particular model as it has no control buttons on it; our daughter is autistic quite brilliant and quite obsessed with constantly skipping chapters on her programs.  A DVD player with no on-board controls is vital for us to watch anything as a family (and we hide the remotes because she knows how to use them better than the rest of us).  This player was a god-send in so many ways simply because the only buttons on the unit were power and eject.The image is black and white only and partially frozen overlapping compiling images as the movies progress.  I changed cords to no avail.  In other words it's a bad product and I highly recommend you not purchase it.$32.  4 months and it broke.","negative"

"cute but annoying big buzz when you turn it on","Well it was a nice size but am returning it because when you turn it on it makes a significant buzz sound which interferes with trying to hear anything  else.","negative"
"Busted from day 1","Bought it it came took it out of the box got it all set up I pressed the open tray button DVD in hand and butt primed and ready for some quality time on the couch and... It whirred and nothing happened. The tray wouldn't open. So yeah probably should give this one a miss.","negative"
"Piece of junk","Don't waste your money; this is a piece of junk.  After about 40 minutes of playing a DVD the unit shuts itself off and nothing I do makes it power up again.  And I have a brand new DVD stuck inside the player.","negative"
"Where there's smoke...","Literally burned up after 4 weeks of use.  The player began to smoke and ceased operation last night.  We only used the player 1x per week to show videos for a class.  Unbelievably low-quality workmanship.  I guess you really do get what you pay for.","negative"
"DOES NOT WORK WITH BLU-RAY DVDs","This product is great for travel however there was no indication that it would not play Blu-ray DVDs.  Also when I tried using the subtitle feature on the remote I received an error message.  Don't buy this unit if you want to play all DVDs.","negative"
"Not Thrilled At All","I received it after over a week of waiting and it wasn't working. I got a power signal when I plugged it in but the remote wouldn't open it and the buttons on the machine wouldn't open it so that I could put the movie in. Also sucks that I have to  mail it back and then wait to get money back.","negative"

"you can throw it in the garbage.","Very low quality as it should be for the price. It did not work at all. I opened it to load a disc and it would not close. Also there are only 2 buttons on the machine (power button and play button) so if you lose the very small remote you can throw it in the garbage.","negative"

"DO NOT RECOMMEND.","DVD PLAYER DOES NOT  MEET MY NEEDS.  IT DOES NOT RETAIN THE STOP AND PAUSE FUNCTIONALITIES I.E. DURING PLAYBACK  WHEN YOU SELECT STOP AND TURN OFF THE PLAYER THE MOVIE DOES NOT CONTINUE FROM WHERE IT STOPPED BUT STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN ROM THE BEGINNING.  LIKEWISE IF PAUSE IS SELECTED  FOR 15 MINUTES  IT AUTOMATICALLY  CHANGES TO PLAY  MODE AND THE MOVIE RESTARTS FROM THE BEGINNING.  DO NOT RECOMMEND.","negative"

"Please read before purchasing and save yourself the money","This product is absolutely aweful. After two days of having it the device began to fail reading the DVD intermittently.

"Crappy But Useful","Ok listen this thing is basically a piece of crap but it works and it serves my purpose which is to watch and learn my Nia Technique routines on a little tv monitor while working in the kitchen. You can hear the motor spin the remote has to be in direct line to have the device read it and even then you have to push the button a few times and it doesn't remember where you were watching the dvd; so when it shuts off automatically should you walk away to do something you come back to find it shut off (good saves power) and have to restart and find your place again (time waster). My husband is starting to download all my training dvds on his computer so now I will be able to watch them on my Apple TV. In the meantime I feel a bit like a cave woman.","negative"

"I bought this for its small form factor and ...","I bought this for its small form factor and I figured that a simple DVD player should simply play a DVD with no bells and whistles. When it came it worked although loudly humming while doing so. But shortly after the return windown closed it stopped accepting discs. All discs. New and clean ones. You put a disc it it humms for a bit and says no disc. Now I'm stuck with it.","negative"

"No S-video output","Looked for an hour to find a DVD player that has an S-video output.  This one says in the description that it has a Coaxial and an S-video output.  au contraire It has neither of these.  Fine little DVD player except for the liar that wrote the description.  Maybe liar is a little harsh maybe it was someone that simple thought they would write a description about something they knew very little about.  Don't think it's worth returning since it was very cheap.","negative"
"Stopped working after one use!","It looked ok when it arrived and even using it the first time it froze on me.  I reset it and it made it for the rest of the session.  The next time I went to use it the door only opened half way and now wont do anything.","negative"
"Cheap worthless piece of JUNK.","What a cheap worthless piece of junk. The picture is blurred and not crisp even on a new high definition television.

My Roku is connected into my projector and works fine through an HDMI cable but this player only gives me video through the HDMI. I had to hook up the red and white cables for sound. Anyone else have this problem? Update : Someone who read this review helped me with this problem by instructing me to reprogram the settings.Update 10/10/13 : I used this player rarely. Months ago I started having trouble getting it to turn on. The other day it totally stopped working. I watched about one movie every 2 weeks since I've had it.

After using it for a while I realized that it was probably ahead of it's time when it came out.  Unfortunately now it's so far behind it's time it can no longer compete with other players.  It is really a pitiful player.","negative"

After searching through Google and the Product Q&As on Amazon I've realized that I'm not the only customer with this problem.It's great for a basic MP3 player. My boys are listening to music and audiobooks without a problem. But I chose this one because it also did video... which is apparently a lie. It's obvious by the title that the seller is being intentionally deceitful so I've brought this to Amazon's attention also.","negative"

"Some of the recordings sound good however","Some of the recordings sound good however there are times with it seems like the plastic casing is vibrating and causing it to be really hard to understand. Once you delete a recording the next one will take it's place. In other words if you have 7 recordings and you delete recording number 3. The next time you record something and go to find it it will not be recording 8 but instead it will be 3. This makes it very hard to track you recordings at time. If you are recording something it is usually a 1 shot deal. Wish I had paid a little more for a better one.","negative"
"a good product.","Update: I bought my device on August 11 and it only lasted two months. It records two seconds then pauses then records a couple more seconds a minute later.  I can't return the device because it's outside Amazon's return period. I wouldn't purchase this again.This device doesn't record mp3sonly wav. It will play mp3s. I am able to convert using VLC player but it adds an extra inconvenient step. The product description doesn't clearly tell you that it doesn't actually record mp3. Otherwise a good product.","negative"

A replacement might work but a refund might be better.","negative"
"Device Failure","Cheap plastic construction. It quit responding to my computer. Tried other computers and it ended up being some kind of problem with the devices hard drive.

"Wouldn't Purchase again","I'm a college student and I needed a voice recorder for my lectures in class to study to. The recorder did a relatively good job but I felt like the instructions it came with were very basic and didn't really help that much. It tell you what the buttons do but that's about it. After using it a few times the recorder kept stopping mid recording and I kept on having to press record again. Then it stopped recording altogether and the red flashing light kept blinking and the instruction manual couldn't help me.Overall the look of the recorder looks a little cheap very light plastic and the LED screen is very basic. I would say if you know how to use this recorder and you don't have any problems then go ahead and purchase it but I've already given this recorder two chances and both times i've had problems with it so I would rather spend a little extra money and go for a quality recorder that wont give you any problems.","negative"

"16 dollars later...","ok listen here friends i'm gonna tell u a story.once upon a time there was a kid. the kid wanted to track their steps and listen to music but in an easy inexpensive way. but how do I do this? the kid asked themselves. so to utilize their amazon prime membership with free two day shipping they found a watch that looked nice and new and not too hard to figure out. two days later the doorbell rang. the kid rushed to the door to get their much anticipated box. after a lot of opening through boxes and packaging the watch was finally free and out in the world. the kid began to try and sync their watch to their phone. success was achieved. so the kid decided to call her sister from her new piece of technology in excitement. but could she? alas she could not. despite the bt notification app installed. she tried and tried (and tried) to figure out the features of the watch but to no avail. calling? no. texting? not a chance. pedometer? only if u dream it. the kid was at a loss. so the kid turned to the only resource they had left: the manual. the kid read and read only to find the manual listed solely the features of the watch. not only this but the grammar in the manual was that of a third grader trying to express their feelings. the kid sunk her head back in frustration. 16 dollars gone. the kid could have gone to the dollar store to buy 16 things. but no they put their faith in something unworthy. the kid decided it wasn't worth the trouble. so the kid looked up its return policy. nothing used or opened may be returned it read. the kid was at a loss. and yes at more of a loss than of 16 dollars.I am that kid ladies and gentleman.do yourself a favor and buy an apple watch.","negative"

"Ok But Not Okay","This Smart Watch worked good enough but then the pins on the watch strap that allow you to secure it onto your wrist broke off just after a few days use. The pins seem to be made of some kind of brittle metal . . . how ridiculous . . . because the watch itself continues to work but is absolutely useless because it can no longer be worn on my wrist. I can't believe a manufacturer would make a reasonably good quality Smart Watch and then place it on a crappy low quality strap that can't even last a week. Don't buy this watch no matter how low priced. The strap pins will break and leave the watch useless to you. Also the way the strap is made or set into the watch doesn't look like you would be able to buy a replacement strap. So when the strap goes the watch will be useless. Don't Buy this.","negative"

The data and icons on the face are far too small to manipulate with a finger-tip so you're left with using a stylus.  Setup was trial and error.  The instructions (such as they are) may have more good as packing.  Really.Connecting to my android was another exercise in hit-or-miss.  It took quite a few tries to get it connected to my phone.  Frankly save yourself the frustration and buy a better watch.","negative"

"VERIZON CUSTOMERS - this is NOT the smart watch for you.","I missed the return date on this.  I purchased this because I wasn't sure a transaction went through when my computer froze - so I thought well just in case it did I'll get a different one and just it case it didn't at least I'll have one. First off IT DOES WORK.Second if you're a Verizon customer STOP RIGHT HERE. This WILL NOT work for you.  You cannot get a sim card if Verizon is your carrier.  I think other carriers support these but not Verizon.Third with bluetooth it is EXTREMELY limited.  It at least functions well as a watch which was my primary goal although I want to lift my arm to see the time not push a button.Last The band....  It is REALLY hard to get it to close and stay closed.It's kind of like the fitbit closure...it's good just not perfect!It's not the worst thing ever it just won't get used much.  It looks a lot like an Apple watch - many friends thought it was one.  I'm sure I'll just pass this on to my kids.  At least I was able to see if I would go back to wearing a watch. The size wasn't as horrible as I thought - I just wish I would have returned it in time as I could have applied the $ to an Apple watch.It DOES work...just not for me.If they would expand the capabilities it might not be so bad.... so it's Meh.  If a child wants a smart watch...this might be a good place to start. Fun FYI - getting a  sim card and ability to use it WILL incur an additional fee on your cell phone bill - the card may be free but the service DOES cost money.  AND - you can't just ask for a sim card.  They have to do everything for you - see your device etc.","negative"

Without that button I can not do anything I can not even see the time.To turn it on I have to use a click Or a needle.

"False Advertising","Well this certainly wasn't the best buy in the whole world. Really though it was just false advertising. First off the actual screen is much smaller than depicted on the first picture. It's a small square. Second it's completely black. The picture makes it seem like it's a got a grey-black look to it. It doesn't. Thirdly the actual features you can do with the smartwatch are pretty limited. There are only like three things you can do with the smartwatch unless you have a phone or sim card. Fourthly there are only three different watches you can get. And all of them are standard clocks. Not one digital clock. No digital clock with a pretty flower in the background No modern numbers displaying 11:30 in a cool way; No Just 3 pixelated boring standard watch faces.With all things considered it's a $17 smartwatch. I mean come on people. The fact that it turns on and displays something in the first place is quite an accomplishment on its own. So if you wanna have something to fool your friends with or you just want to look cool wearing a smartwatch this is the product for you. If you're actually looking for something that you can be productive with I would look at watches little more expensive.","negative"

"Most definitely recommend!","My fiance` who will be my husband on Saturday October 13 2018 needed a new Fire HD Tablet desperately!  We both loved the fact that this had a charging dock and show mode also which are really great features!  He absolutely loves his new tablet and while I have a Prime Membership he has Amazon Music Unlimited...he is The Music Man after all and plays THE BEST MUSIC OF ANYONE IN THE DISABILITY FACILITY THAT WE LIVE IN!!!!  He had over 10000 songs downloaded to the cloud and to his his SD Card as well.  Since getting this new tablet he has created (4) FOUR Playlist's for our wedding this coming weekend each list containing 121 songs.  On top of that he has also downloaded nearly 800 other songs for our (and our friend's) listening pleasure!  I also have a Fire HD 8 though mine is nearly 2 years old come this December.  But it still works very well (Knock on wood) and until it gives out I'll continue to use it. When the time comes and I MUST buy a new tablet I will be sure to get this very same tablet!!!Vicki Banks","positive"
"Good For Gaming","I bought this monitor in order to play it with my Xbox One. It's a good Monitor it wasn't what I expected honestly. You know You get what you paid for. I feel like I got more than what I paid for since I'm able to play Dark Souls 3 with good graphics. It's a cheap Monitor but it's worth if if you're just using it to play games at your desk.Just incase you guys don't knowIt has1 HDMI Input Port1 VGA Input Port1 DVI Input PortI recommend this TV for anyone with a low budget looking for a good monitor.","positive"
"Works Perfect as a Second Monitor for Work","Let me start off by saying that I'm not a gamer and I'm not a computer expert.  I simply needed a decently sized second monitor to use while I'm working.  I was looking for something reasonably priced with solid reviews and this works perfect for what I need.If you're into gaming or want something with amazing speakers it sounds like this probably isn't the monitor for you based on other reviews.  If you're just looking for a monitor to do some work on like I was then I would definitely recommend this.* As a note the first monitor I got didn't work when I hooked it up.  It had a bright white screen no matter what I hooked it into and it wouldn't display anything.  I emailed Sceptre's support and they said that there was an issue with the display panel.  They also said that I could send it to them to get repaired for free because it's covered under warranty for a year.  I decided to contact Amazon as well and they let me exchange it for a new monitor.  The new monitor works great and Amazon provided me with a prepaid shipping label so I didn't have to pay anything extra.  I decided not to let this bring down the rating because Sceptre's support team was very responsive and Amazon made the exchange extremely easy.  Still I thought that it was worth mentioning.","positive"
"Great little monitor highly recommended - no DVI though on mine (a 2nd HDMI instead)","The model I received was marked on the box as a E205W-1600 which according to this description and the manufacturer's site should have VGA DVI and HDMI ports. The model in the box had 2-HDMI's and one VGA (which is actually what I wanted - this matches the picture included in the description above).The monitor went together easily. The bracket on the monitor for the base is very sturdy and the angle adjustment works fine. The VESA holes (the smaller size) are obstructed by the bracket but if you are hanging the monitor you can use the offsets (included) which will allow that to be screwed in as long as you don't have the pedestal installed. If you like I are placing a mini-PC on the back the offsets aren't tall enough to get over the pedestal. However you can screw one offset into another and get two screwholes that clear the pedestal. That was secure enough for my mini-PC bracket (a Beelink Apollo Lake Windows machines)The picture is quite good and the colors are accurate (in Windows you'll want to adjust the Gamma which is typical and not an issue with the monitor). I was surprised at the quality really very nice.The speakers are 2W so temper your expectations but they seemed to work just fine with an acceptable sound. You can adjust the volume using some buttons on the case of the monitor (or of course via Windows or whatever input device you are using)) You have an audio in jack (which I did not test it's meant to pump in the sound if you are using the VGA jack) and a audio out jack which works well with external speakers.The case has typical buttons for power and the manipulate the on screen settings and the aforementioned volume controls. And a button to toggle from VGA to HDMI1 HDMI2. This model found the active port when I was testing it.My box came with the TV power adapter (it is a box on a wire adapter with the box at the plug so it takes up space on a power strip). A VGA cord manuals and installation hardware including 2 screws to attach the pedestal four offset screws for the VESA mount and interestingly a little phillips screwdriver.The monitor is light thin angle adjusts and the speakers are small but not distorting and it has audio out for headphones/speakers. The picture is good and it took less than 5 minutes from opening the packing to having it running (including installing the VESA bracket for my mini-PC). Highly recommended but please check with the vendor first if you need the DVI I got two HDMI instead of DVI and HDMI - all these models have the VGA I believe.","positive"
"Surprisingly good quality with a ridiculously good price.","Purchased for my father's computer in order to get him out of his old 4:3 Dell LCD. I'm very surprised by the quality. If it were for me I'd have sprung for an ASUS with Full HD but this was extremely inexpensive and he doesn't do much more than browse the internet and play some basic games on his PC. I was surprised at the quality of the included speakers so much that I recycled his old Logitechs that came with a keyboard combo that I handed down a decade ago. There's no ghosting even in the Doom demo. This monitor is more than enough quality and the fact that it sells for under USD$100 is *insane*. I also didn't realize that Sceptre is an American company that has been manufacturing monitors for over 30 years. I thought it was a Korean 'B' brand. Bonus! We're both very happy with the monitor.","positive"
"SCEPTRE FLAT SCREEN MONITOR","SCEPTRE FLAT SCREEN MONITOR. This replaces my ACER Monitor that finally kicked off after 10 years. This new model is much lighter than the old. I was surprised at the weight difference between the two. But 10 years in the computer world is like dog years. In the rest of the world 75 years have passed. This was as easy to set up as changing the batteries in a flashlight...IF YOU IGNORE THE DIRECTIONS which are less than useless. Attaching the base to the monitor took about 5 minutes. The manufacturer even included a standard Phillips screwdriver- as opposed to a single-use piece of junk.  Saved me having to hunt down a screwdriver myself. The Monitor arrived within a few days of purchase and is in perfect condition. THANKS!!","positive"
"Did not need to read the manual because it was so easy to figure out","I am not one for writing reviews but it this case I made an exception. It makes me laugh when I see some of the cons that were posted on this item. For the price and quality of this monitor I rate it Five Star Plus. I received this item and right out of the box connected it to my computer. Did not need to read the manual because it was so easy to figure out. After connecting it to my computer and seeing the results for the first time I new I had purchased the right monitor. The quality of the display was far more then I expected. Very bright Clear and fast responding. Again you could not buy a dinner for what i paid for this item. So for all of you who find fault with this monitor you are the type of person that would find fault with any monitor no matter what it cost. For all future buyers I would recommend this monitor and know you will be very happy with your purchase. I have built many computers and repaired many monitors and what you get with this monitor for the price is well worth it. You don't have to believe me but this unit is all Pro: in my opinion.","positive"
"FANTASTIC MONITOR & NO REGRETS.","Received my new monitor today and have been using it for several hours now and I can't rave enough about it.I hooked it up Via HDMI port and it setup on my Nvidia GTX 750ti graphics card without a hitch no resizing of the desktop was needed as it would be if you had it hooked up to a TV.The picture is clear and colors are bright just as you would expect from HDMI All factory presets of the monitor is perfect for me I am a gamer and it has no lag in the rapidly changing pictures that occur during a long gaming session but at 5ms I wouldn't expect it to.Power pack is self contained inside the unit itself so there's no extra pack taking up space on your desk a real plus to me since I hate desktop clutter And the sound is pretty decent for being built in speakers on a monitor which really don't bother me because if I play Farm Sim 2017 it is loud enough for me to hear the games sounds and if I am playing something like Fallout 4 I prefer a headset anyway since those game sounds bother my wife And I prefer the ability to hear things coming at me from all angles up close and personal as compared to even the best desktop speakers. I have no regrets buying this monitor and at a sub $100 price tag and it being a 20 widescreen it can't be beat.","positive"
"it's a steal","At $70 it's impossible to find a better hdmi monitor. There were zero dead pixels on the one that I got and the image is incredible.A couple side notes:1) it can have up to 7 dead pixels without qualifying for a replacement under the manufacturer warranty (if this is a big deal to you then maybe consider spending more than $70 for a monitor)2) the stem that mounts into the base is not easily removable. If you are going to wall-mount this unit plan on prying open the shell to remove that stem.","positive"
"and sound from speakers is good enough. very happy with this purchase and the ...","this monitor is being used for digital signage at trade shows.  i opened it up turned it on hooked the tablet up and voila i am looping video.no dead pixels and sound from speakers is good enough.  very happy with this purchase and the price was the best part.  if i ever need another i will get another one fo these.","positive"
"Not big but includes everything you need","This isn't a large monitor however the package includes everything you need including a magnetic tipped small Phillips head screwdriver with a rubber handle.  The monitor _does_ have speakers that work with HDMI connections which given the $65 price of the monitor was a pleasant surprise.  The buttons are on the back and the back surface is not 100% flat--there is a bump-out at bottom for the logic controllers and connectors.  The OEM stand does tilt up / down but it sits pretty low--you will need phone books shelf etc. if you want it  to be up higher.  There is an audio out and in on the monitor's back for 3.5mm audio connections.It's as another reviewer said-- by 2018 standards it's smallish but for the cost they give you a lot.","positive"
"Great monitor for the price","Excellent monitor for the price. If you plan on mounting it don't bother installing the stand. Everyone who reviewed this monitor and complained about the stand being hard to remove should be more worried about their poor planning skills than the leg on a $70 monitor.}Pros:InexpensivePretty good build qualityGreat UI and customization optionsEasy to assembleVery thin bezel (less than 1/2)60 and 75hzCons:The speakers are really really bad. Like really bad. Think 1945 transistor radio bad.1600x900 and not 1920x1080The blue light filter is a nice touch but ultimately useless compared to real eye care monitors.I bought this monitor to replace a 19 Samsung TV that I was using as my second monitor. It is less narrow than the Samsung by 2 but has a larger screen. I use it mostly to keep Discord up or Netflix/Hulu on while I'm working on my other monitor. I'm honestly thinking about buying another one so I can have the same set up at work as I do at home.","positive"
"Does exactly what I hoped it would","Monitor does exactly what I hoped it would do. I'm using iton an Electronics workbench so I needed a small footprint / monitor to switch between a Linux laptop and a Raspberry Pi for development. Monitor switching between the two different HDMI inputs is easy with buttons on the back  picture quality is good haven't really tested the sound yet but no complaints and for the price just can't beat it","positive"
"Great Value HDMI or VGA Led Monitor","Just received it. It was well packed. Installing the stand power and cable were obvious. The stand is steadier than the stand on my previous 20 monitor. Picture is bright and clear sound is fine for standard computer sound. The power button and controls are on the back on the rh side. I did not like that location at first but it took only a few minutes to learn to use the buttons by touch. No problems at this point. Some buyers have complained of early failure in this monitor. If it proves to be unreliable I will come back and revise this review. (10-4-2018)","positive"
"Exceptional value. The picture quality is outstanding","Exceptional value. The picture quality is outstanding. I bought the monitor for a little used computer it's such a high quality 20 display I instead have it on my main home computer. The controls are easy to see and access. It works flawlessly. This Screen is worth for more than it's sold for. You will be glad you bought it. I am.","positive"
"Works amazing for school","I just received it today so granted everything is working so far. The box got delivered right on time. Inside has the base and even mounting screws PLUS a screwdriver (very nice add!). Turned it on an good quality! It’s definitely not as clear as my MacBook but as an additional screen for reading my textbooks it does great for the price!","positive"
"Buy this!!","I have only had this monitor for two weeks but so far I love it. I needed a second monitor to hook to my laptop to have multiple screens. I first went to Best Buy and they talked me into a ridiculously expensive monitor that I regretted immediately as I got home. I don’t need anything fancy. I looked on amazon and found this for a fraction of the price. 2 days later I received this and returned the Best Buy monitor. I did have to get an additional HDMI cord to connect this to my laptop but that was no big deal. So far everything is perfect","positive"
"Great value for what you get!","I currently use this for my monitor on my Home Security system. Picture is SUPER clear. I love the fact that this has all the different inputs that you can use. This is placed in my office and there isn't a lot of space so the built in speakers aspect works PERFECT for me. They are clear and work really well. I will definitely purchase this again especially for this price!","positive"
"Excellent buy for the price!!!!","First let me say I am not one of these people that are obsessed graphics quality. Having said that this is an excellent monitor for the price. I wanted something I could mount in my hobby room as a spare. I could use as a back up for my lap top or those rare occasions when I wanted to use more than one monitor. I also use this for my x-box and for ham radio. Which was possible because it comes with all 3 possible inputs. NOT all monitors do. Also I liked it came with per-installed taped holes for a wall mount. Which I liked because it didn't take up space on my work bench.","positive"
"Great Picture Quality","Clear picture great extra screen for my MacBook Air. It makes working on my research and/or school work so much easier when I can spread it out across two screens. You don't have to worry about resizing whatever you are trying to drag to your second display like you do with some extended screens. Instead this one just stays the same size as it originally would on your main screen. It's truly a thin beautiful monitor. The sound it's that great but that wasn't what I was looking for in a monitor. So if you're looking for a great sound you shouldn't buy this but if you are looking for a great picture and an easily accessible display then this product is for you.","positive"
"Leave room for the power brick/wall wort. These are fed by a low voltage line. I have two.","The picture is very bright. I had to tone it down a bit for my eyes. I do have 2 so that might be my problem. Comes with a VGA cable each. I'm running one HDMI to HDMI and the other DVI to HDMI. No obvious difference in the picture. I haven't tried the sound but I wouldn't expect the tiny speakers to be any good for anything but system sounds. An inexpensive two speaker and subwoofer set would be a good investment if you don't have your own sound set up already.Just leave room for the power blocks to blug in.","positive"
"Colors are great connects easily to my laptop","For the price this can't be beat. I wanted a cheap 2nd monitor so I could work a second screen off my work laptop but didnt want to spend alot because I work was not reimbursing me. This has worked seamlessly. Colors are great connects easily to my laptop really no issues whatsoever. Very pleased overall.","positive"
"Good second monitor!","When I first purchased this monitor I loved it! Great bright colors and was super easy to get set up. Less than 12 hours of having it the screen started to glitch and break up with random lines. I was extremely disappointed by this since I hadn't even used it at this point.I called customer service they sent me a new one and I haven't had any issues since! It's a great monitor not sure what was up with the first one.","positive"

"Just so rambling of what I think of","This Monitors is really good for me. I have a 27in Monitors which is mainly for my gaming and We'll of course videos so I decided to buy Sceptre. I mainly use the Sceptre to check inbox edit videos and also look at YouTube while I'm playing. It's not a great Gaming monitor it mainly more for office related or Adobe program  monitor. I haven't really put to much time in the monitor itself so I don't really know what it's really capable of but I choose not to because all I really needed was a Side Chick* (Second Monitor) to check other programs to see if they are running correctly without me having to [Alt+Tab] to exit of my game. Overall I find this to be a good monitor. I'll came back later to right a proper review to see all capabilities and what not. But if you need a second cheap monitor that work this is the right one to go to. 👍","positive"
"Worth the price.","This monitor was better than expected. I have a very bright room and have no issues with seeing what is on the screen or having to deal with issues with glare. I did not have to set up anything to improve the quality of the picture. I just plugged it in my computer and turn it on and it was perfect. I was extremely happy with the quality of it that I was showing it off to whoever came into my room. I had thought it might be a little pixelated but it is clear and handles old and new videos well.","positive"

Color and Hue are pretty much right on with no adjustments right out of the Box for the price there can be no complaints. one of the best features are the three different video connections just wish I hadn't gone cheap on the cameras so I would have Sound to see what the speakers sound like on the monitor also it did come with the HDMI cable that one reviewer claimed it didn't.","positive"
"amazing monitors with good picture quality","amazing monitors with good picture quality comes with generous hdmi cable.  Speakers are low quality but that is expected nevertheless they also work perfectly and were plug and play.  would buy again!","positive"
"Better than I expected!","Perfect monitor for the price! Very bright and colors are vivid on auto settings. You can play with adjustments if you want but it's fine on factory settings. The only problem is that the built-in speakers are weak which is to be expected.The monitor is thin and it doesn't take a lot of room on your desk. Actually this monitor is better than I expected.","positive"
"Great for casual gaming","I'm using this in my dorm room for my PS4. Comes with several cords but I only needed the HDMI and the power outlet to get my PS4 working. Also comes with audio output and also a built-in speaker that works perfectly fine if you're at sitting distance from the monitor. Sound and graphics work fine I'm not much of a techs person but this works perfectly to play games on casually :)","positive"
"out of the box great especially with very inexpensive 4 year warranty","I see complaints about color quality but what do you want for $66. especialy with 4 year warranty.Glossy large type  manual. you cant tilt it. I bought it because i could never see the entire screen All important information seems to be on the right side. So i had to move the bar over on my 12 inch screen.Everything is great so far.","positive"
"Spectre is spectacular!","I bought this very nice very thin monitor so I could set up my Raspberry Pi without having to commandeer the family TV! I was surprised to find not 1 but 2 HDMI inputs in addition to the VGA connection. I appreciate the fact that they included a VGA cable and a HDMI-to-DVI cable even though I didn't need either for my setup. The built-in speakers won't rock the house but they get the job done. I will probably use the VESA mounts in the future when I find a permanent home for this little guy but in the meantime I can put this on my kitchen table and still have room enough for a couple of McRibs!","positive"

"Excellent picture quality  easy to connect and takes up less space than some of the other monitors on the market.","This is a awesome monitor. Picture is great.. clear and sharp.  Its so much more than we expected.Very happy with this purchase.  Had all the cables needed.. Customer Service is great.","positive"
"Super Price for a good monitor","For the price  I can't complain - arrived on time  packaged well came with all the cords you could need for multiple configurations.  Not big but not small either.  I would recommend it for use like mine - playing older games.","positive"
"If You Are Buying The 20 Inch Monitor In 2018 Read This!","The monitor is awesome and the people in the questions section are saying that it only has 1 HDMI port because they have the 2017 version. If you are buying the 20 inch monitor in 2018 there is no worry. There is 2 HDMI ports and they also have a VGA and a DVI and it comes with a VGA to VGA cable and a HDMI to DVI cable but there is no HDMI to HDMI cable. The monitor is great quality for the price and the volume is ok but sounds kind of muffled. Hopefully this review clears up all the commotion in the comments and helps everyone.","positive"
"Bright clear display sturdy stand great price.","For the price this monitor is great. I use it for my home office as a secondary monitor to my laptop screen and my only regret is not getting a size larger. The stand is sturdy the image is bight and sharp and it's not ugly.","positive"
"Great inexpensive monitor!","We bought a LaView home security camera system and I ordered this monitor for the DVR unit.  Works beautifully plug and play through HDMI (but also has the VGA adapter on the back).  Great video quality!","positive"

"I love it!","Mine came in a few weeks ago and I love it so much. The colours are bright and you can mess with your colour settings with the menu button! TF2 Dota 2 CS:GO EVE ect.; They all look very crisp. Even my sister's digital art looks 10x better on it! The LED lighting does make it a little hard to stare at for extended periods of time though. Still an absolutely wonderful monitor and it's pretty cheap compared to other brands!I would definitely recommend this monitor to those who're on a budget or are after a really nice cheap gaming/art monitor.","positive"

"Best value for the money!","EXTREMELY NICE PICTURE and VALUE FOR YOU MONEY.  The monitor comes with power cord and VGA cable.  However the monitor has VGA HDMI and DVI inputs.  It is VESA 100 compatible however the swivel base stem is NOT removable;  Still a great value!","positive"
"Good for the price","Got this as a 3rd monitor does its job well.  Came with 4 standoffs for vesa mounting as the stand mount sticks off the back a bit without the stand installed.  Picture quality is pretty good for the price.  Haven't tested the speakers so I cannot speak to the quality of those. There are alot of old reviews for older models take those with a grain of salt as not all of them reflect the current product.","positive"
"This is a steal for the price","Had this for around 6 months and is still doing great. I've transported around with little protection in a backpack and has yet to take any damage. The speakers are bad but the size is good. If you are using this from less than 2 feet away this is the monitor to use.","positive"

"I love this device","Ideal UserThis product can be used by anyone. I think the most productive user would be a person who has an iPhone because you get text messages through your apple watch if you have an iPhone. Also if the person does any physical activity the user of this product will have a tremendous amount of benefits. The age range for people that would have the most benefits from this product is anywhere from teenagers to older adults. If you are looking for an apple watch the watch with cellular is a good choice.CriteriaThis watch does have a bit of water resistant. If you get it wet and dry it off it will not break but it is not waterproof. There is also a very good durability with this watch. I play softball with it on and have taken ground ball off of it and hit is against multiple objects and there are no scratches on my screen or on the watch.PerksWith the cellular perk of the apple watch you can use your watch a phone. If you don’t like carrying your phone around with you while you are running the cellular part of the watch will give you the ability to run and listen to music with only your watch. could download apps onto the watch to get more information why you are working out or sleeping. I have a sleeping app that lets me know how long I was asleep throughout the night how long I was awake and how long I was restless. With the Apple Watch you will get any notifications you approve of from your phone through your watch. You can also see how many steps you have gone throughout the day and you can check your heart rate whenever you want to. I have tested to see the accuracy of the watch compared to checking my heart rate manually and with both I received the same heart rate. Along with checking your heart rate whenever you want you can go back and look at what your peak heart rate was for the day and for the week.","positive"
"Why you should buy an Apple Watch","The Apple Watch Series 3 42mm Smartwatch is an excellent product and serves many purposes. I wear my watch while performing a variety of different tasks such as: going for a run at the gym with dress attire to work and even for everyday life activities. The ideal user of this watch is teenagers to young adults that are always on the go wanting more technology at their finger tips and have a taste for fashion. The Apple Watch has been worn with impressive quality for about the last year. Some of the criteria that was used to evaluate the watch included: durability eye appeal and convenience.Durability and Eye AppealThe overall quality of the Apple Watch has been outstanding. The hard face cover and water resistance allows the watch to be worn every day in every environmental condition. The thin and sleek design make the watch lightweight but the aluminum build adds longevity and durability. The watch is offered in several different colors: white silver gold and black; allowing buyers to express their own fashion choices. The watch is also allowed to have different bands attached to it whether you want a more athletic band for your run through the park or a leather band for your day at the office. The Apple Watch’s design allows for durability in any situation and the freedom of color choices adds an aspect of style.ConvenienceConvenience is one of the best qualities about the Apple Watch. With its location right on your wrist it adds another level of connectivity to your fingertips.

I thought i’d regret buying it because my wrist is small but the 42 mm has really good battery . i left it full charged i didn’t charge it at all through the night and it’s still 86%. I highly recommend though i was a bit upset when i wasn’t able to activate my cellular plan through my carrier but that’s on me. Not through this watch. It’s very nice and overall i am a very happy customer! i’m also kind of glad I bought a refurbished one instead of a new one because refurbished items are $50.00 less cheaper then a new and it’s also way better then a completely used one. Overall i’m pleased with the item i bought. Thank you so much!","positive"

"I Play Video Games","Here's the short version:If you grew up poor and can't mentally justify spending a month of rent in urban California on a single television if you're poor as heck right now but could conceivably afford this television if you've never owned a 4k TV if you've never owned an especially large TV you will not be disappointed by this gigantic freaking monstrosity of a display. It nicely upscales 1080p content it has a nice frame rate it has passable speakers you can hear the bass on and as someone who is picky about delay to the point of 25ms being effectively unusable for music-based games I am very happy with the game mode option that removes the delay typically associated with HDMI displays. It is a good TV and everyone in my family which includes two audio people and a visual artist is extremely happy with it.The detailed version:Given the extremely low cost compared to similarly sized TVs it is surprisingly high quality.The remote is minimal comfortable and easy to use.Has a phone app in case you're one of the many people who habitually misplace the remote. App does exactly the same things the remote does.The speakers kinda suck at low volumes but it's whatever. If you care about audio quality go buy some fancy external hookups. It's good enough that I can bump the Thumper soundtrack and it's still a decent listening quality. Actually plays tones below 200Hz and does so cleanly so it's better than most TVs I've had.It has a game mode that it claims will affect the picture quality but does not noticeably do and the lack of delay is such that it is not noticeable to me a musician to whom 25ms of delay is unacceptably bad and unusable. I'm actually able to play Thumper on the Nintendo Switch with no problems whereas with my previous TV it was so bad that I opted instead to play on console with headphones. This is the feature that I love the most about this TV.The upscaling is such that on my gaming PC I saw no difference between 4k and 1080p when playing GTA5 (except for the frame rate when large distances or a large number of objects are visible which is entirely due to the fact that I'm playing it on a GTX1060).It has a lot of service integrations such as Netflix Hulu Amazon Instant Video Google Play Movies and a few others.IT'S HUGE OH MY GOD I AM BAD AT CONCEPTUALISING PHYSICAL SPACE I DID NOT REALISE HOW BIG FIFTY-FIVE INCHES IS EVEN WHEN ESTIMATING ITS SIZE BASED ON MY EXISTING 40 TELEVISION I LITERALLY HAD TO REARRANGE MY ENTIRE ROOM AND BUILD NEW FURNITURE TO ACCOMMODATE THIS THING???????It's surprisingly thin.Does CEC and has settings to automatically switch channels based on what just turned on.Lots of options for controlling and customising various aspects of the television including picture and audio correction accessibility options including captions and spoken audio transcription (I have not tested the latter feature) and UI skins. You should absolutely poke around the options as much as possible once you get this as there are several options for things like the refresh rate of the display which I imagine is relevant to a lot of people. (I am not intimately familiar with specifics of refresh rates but I have seen no tearing or distortion from fast-motion visuals and things appear to animate smoothly.)Does some advertising for purchasing media through Roku presumably to offset the cost of the device. It isn't especially intrusive and only consists of movie posters in a small portion of the screen at very select times in one part of one menu.Does require a significant amount of opting out of certain things.Overall a fantastically huge featureful and good-looking TV for the cost.Regarding complaints I've seen in other reviews: My product did not show up broken it has not stopped working despite extensive use since I got it I have no complaints about the refresh rate it displays 4k content over HDMI with no issues they say it's a glossy screen but it's really just unusually and disconcertingly smooth and otherwise significantly less glareful and reflective than my previous television it has effectively no inconsistencies with backlighting or colour (just a small spot that's slightly brighter which is only visible at extreme viewing angles or if the screen is effectively displaying nothing but black and I don't mean like really dark or a scene at night I mean like literally it is displaying the colour black over 50% of the screen and only then is it noticeable from a front angle and just barely at that).So if you're one of those folks that buys artisan gold plated audio cables aged seven years in oaken casks if you buy two of the Ti version of the latest nVidia graphics card because you absolutely need to run everything on Ultra at 120FPS in 4k if you're the kind of person who thinks Grey Goose tastes better you probably won't like this TV.If 10% not as good as the best thing for 1/4 of the cost is your jam this is an amazing purchase. I freaking love my new giant TV.","positive"
"Extremely happy with this purchase","I am shocked at the picture quality. I went into this purchase wanting a larger inexpensive TV for the master bedroom. So far I am floored the picture blows away my Panasonic plasma I purchased several years ago (for 3x the price). The Roku OS is super easy The antenna integration and USB storage for recording live programming are great.One small item I can nitpick is the white LED at the bottom center of the TV that remains on after powering off. I haven't dug through all the settings yet I will post an update if I can disable it. Update: The LED can be disabled in settings under power settings.If this set can continue to perform I will replace my main Panasonic Plasma with the new TCL C SeriesThe pic is from a nature show The Hunt streamed from Netflix.I can't imagine a better picture for the price point. That coupled with the Roku OS and I am extremely happy with this purchase","positive"
"1000 Reviews...4.3 stars...yeah I think it's a good TV","4.3 out of 5 stars with almost 1000 reviews (Nov 2017)...how can you go wrong?Well you can't from my experience. I know know...you've been researching TVs like crazy. You love the price of this one but you're not sure because all the pretentious internet videophiles and review sites tell you only Samsungs are real TVs. They must be better right? They're 2-3X as much as this TV. That would be great if they delivered 2-3X better video quality. Well guess what? They don't.Simply put this TV delivers. I won't repeat what everyone else has said. After 1000 reviews you're sick of it. I will share some tidbits about this TV that mattered to me...PROS1. Price - why pay 2-3X more for (maybe) a 5% image quality improvement?2. ROKU - essentially saves you one input and has a good interface.3. Picture - stunning providing the source content is good (if it's not no TV no matter how expensive will look good).4. Inputs - not enough HDMIs but lots of other stuff which is good.CONS1. Inputs - another HDMI or two would've been great.2. Settings - had a hard time figuring this out. You have to be watching something to adjust the more advanced picture settings. Seems weird.3. Dim picture - yeah a bit brighter would've been better. You can tinker with brightness but that just washes the image out.WHO CARES1. Only HDR10 - mmmmkay. Well that's the standard Samsung uses and HDR content is a bit thin currently. Relax Dolby Vision fanboys.2. Crappy viewing angle - that's the way VA panels are (Samsung uses VA too) so such is life.3. It's not a real brand name - big whoop. 1000 consumers on Amazon are pretty stoked about this TV. Screw what CNET thinks.TV SettingsI tried to go with what the experts said. That left me with an overly warm muddy soft picture. If that's what they used to review the TV no wonder why they dinged it on image quality. Their settings sucked not the TV. Anyway I don't care what they're fancy calibration doohickey said here's what worked for me...TV brightness: BrighterPicture mode: Normal (Movie is too red Sports too green Vivid too saturated and grainy Low power lacks punch)Picture size: Auto or DirectAudio effect: NormalSleep timer: OffAdvanced picture settingsDynamic contrast: OffBacklight: 100Brightness: 50 (can try 55-60 but washes out fast)Contrast: 100Sharpness: 25 (everyone loves 0 a little sharp is okay just avoid ghosting and halos)Color: 45Tint: 0Color temperature: Normal (warm = too red cool = too blue)YMMV on these settings and of course do what works best for you. Overall amazing TV value!*** UPDATE ***So it's only been a few weeks but I had a chance to see some real 4K HDR content on this TV and I literally peed myself. Yeah it looks pretty good. I'm not sure how much better a picture can possibly get. You can pay more for a TV but I really don't see why you would.","positive"
"HDR on Xbox One X","For the price you pay this TV is great! I just wanted to post to help anyone with an Xbox One X on how to get HDR working with this TV because by default it does not work. On the Roku TV Home go to settings (not picture settings from the remote) but the settings option on the home page then go to TV inputs select the hdmi port your Xbox is on and in Hdmi mode change it from auto to hdmi 2.Then go to your Xbox one x and in the display settings and advanced video select allow HDR. And that should get it working. Hope this helps anyone else from spending time to find this. Otherwise this TV has been great!","positive"
"Do not hesitate just buy it! Don't let the price fool you!","New update! Posted belowI would like to first start by saying don't hesitate this is an amazing buy and I would gladly recommend to anyone. I honestly love this tv.Now for a quick pro and con list.Pros:•Beautiful picture quality•very light weight but more than sturdy on its included stand (feet)•insanely low price for the quality•the roku smart system is remarkably easy to use•very simple and compact remote that does everything you need it toCons (but VERY minor and not even truly noteworthy)•Rear facing speakers•not as many picture settings as my samsungUPDATE: I downloaded the Roku app on my phone and found out that there is a tab under settings (in the app) called expert picture settings. Tap that and you will see more settings at a custom level. simply make your changes via the app and they instantly take effect on your tv.Now for the in depth review:I bought this to replace my Samsung 40 smart led tv because it was time for a bigger size. Now with having come from a samsung to this tv I will say there a few differences but not any that have to do with quality. It's more about the features. My samsung was essentially a computer whereas this tv is a tv. It's smart for the ability to use any and all streaming services you can imagine but unlike samsung I have not yet found a way to surf the web or use social media. However that is not even remotely important to me I never even used those features anyway. I was merely looking around so I would have a comparison from a big name like samsung to a new less heard of brand like TCL. I noticed a lot of people complained about the lack of brightness in this screen but I have to disagree. I've never had any issues seeing the screen and my tv is positioned directly across the room from a window that gets direct sun from about 6am until 3pm and as long as my blinds (no curtains) are closed I can see the screen absolutely perfectly. Not even my samsung could be seen with the blinds open so I consider this tv to be equal in that respect to a big name brand tv. I've had this tv for about 3 months now and still have nothing to complain about. However for you fellow amazon users I will nit pick so you can know everything possible. Speakers are great however they are on the back of the tv and therefore direct sound backwards. However don't let that deter you because the sound is still great and you don't have to crank it up to hear. It's only an issue if you have kids or a roommate who shares the wall your tv is on. In that case they will probably be able to hear your tv. However Ive always used soundbars when it comes to flat screens which totally solves the extremely minor issue here. All in all this tv is absolutely amazing and I love it. I could easily see this being a $800-$1000 tv. As my title to this review states do not hesitate to buy it really is an amazing tv for an unbelievable price. I will most definitely buy from tcl in the future and have already recommended this tv to several people and will continue to do so.","positive"
"Best thing I ever did was decide to buy this.","After hours of gaming movies and tv this is simply the best TV I've ever purchased! I tweaked some settings (which was incredibly easy) and couldn't stop dropping my jaw. Draw distances in games seemed enhanced somehow.  The colors... The HDR is so worth it. I can't stress enough how worth it the HDR is. Blows my dang mind even the TV's speakers are better than expected bass is noticable. The apps and Roku function very smoothly. I would highly suggest anyone that loves movies or games (or BOTH) to get this TV! Great price for supreme value!!","positive"
"Great TV for the price you can't go wrong with it","Great TV for the price! The up conversion is hit or miss but mostly it is a hit.  I've been recording videos in HD 1080p for many many years wedding videos and such and they looked great on a 1080p TV but the up conversion makes them look even better!  Somehow it can even break down the strands of hair and make them stand out.  With the 720p upconversion it still looks good.  When you start going lower and lower like 480 then it starts to look blotchy and sometimes even worse than the original.The overall picture is great!  The screen is bright the blacks are solid the colors are vivid and brilliant it truly looks great!  with the 120hz I don't see too much motion lag in faster action movies I haven't watched sports with it yet though.The sound blah... terrible!  No matter what anyone else says it's only good enough to listen to nothing great.  I just hooked up a set of powered PC speakers to it for now and they sound much better.The menu is super simple and easy to navigate and use it is very intuitive.  The remote is the same it has enough features and the buttons are placed where you would expect them to be.  The video and other menu's though are very simplistic.  By default you are able to select most of their pre-programmed and use them easily.  They honestly look great already I don't believe many people will want to deviate from that.  But there is an advanced menu as well where you can change all the individual settings like saturation hue warmth and the others.From what I have experienced seen previously and researched as well Sony and Samsung make the best TVs if you pay for one of their higher end models but for the price and value this TV can't be beat.  I'm glad I paid the extra $50 for this 2017 version over the 2016 version.  If anyone is looking at the 2016 model here are the main differences I seen between them:1) 2016 has no HDR so no true black and no vivid color contrast2) 2016 energy star rating is not as well I think you will save about $11 - 15 in electricity bills in a year with the 2017 model. So in 2 or 3 years it will pay for the difference.I would highly recommend this TV to anyone who is looking for an EXCELLENT low or moderate budget TV.  It is also great for someone who is not as tech savoy as the remote and menu's are easy to use.  I can only compare this to a Septre 50 4K TV I bought last year to see how the videos and picture would look on a 4K TV.  The video on this TV is much brighter and distinguished the upconversion on it is much better the sound on the Septre was better though than this one.","positive"

"My parents love this and it makes me incredibly jealous!","I bought this TV for my parents they were still on an old 55 CRT projection. This sounded like a good deal. Wow what an understatement. I didn't realize that it was HDR & 4K! The picture is outstanding and the menu system is really snappy. This eliminated so many wires and remotes for my parents I now have a pile of electronics I'm not sure what I'm going to do with. My parents are 88 & 80... and they have no problem operating and using the television which is about the biggest endorsement I can give anything!","positive"
"Please Read - Detailed Summary for the worried user","I spent close 20 hours of research on TV's (sadly not kidding). Through my research I learned about all the new specs and what specs make a good TV like: LED 4K HDR WCG 120 hrtz etc. besides WCG this TV has them all for at affordable price NOTHING comes close. People are so caught up on 4K.. HDR (High Dynamic Range) make a better difference to the eye than 4K (Google it). Now there are two types of HDR some have both but this one has HDR10 which is the endustry standard (Dolby Vision HDR is better but not as popular and barely can tell a difference). Let me say I was so worried that this TV would ship and I would be upset. This was not the case... the TV comes with Roku (a value in itself) and a very user friendly remote. Some people complain about the viewing angles and sound but to be honest - I really don't think it's bad like at all (obviously not the best). Not enough to really complain. When I tested an HDR video on the YouTube app (search hdr) I was amazed. The blacks are so rich.Bottom line I was worried at first but came to be impressed. But that said if you want THE PERFECT TV - this is not for you. If you have the money look elsewhere. But for all us normal people that don't want to spend 3 months rent on a TV - THIS IS FOR YOU. Finally I do recommended the 5 year warrenty it's only 50$ and it covers a lot. Since this isn't a Panasonic or Samsung or Philips tv - the parts used to make the tv might not be the best. I've had many flat screens break over the years (BRAND TV'S!!!) so pay the extra 50$.Picture: 9.1Sound: 7Remote: 9Design: 7Interface: 10 (just because it has roku)I hope this helps!Enjoy!","positive"
"holy crap what an awesome tv","Here are my small frustrations so far most of which are not the tv's fault. The mount was delivered a few hours before the TV. I got to work and put the mount up on the wall. I made my best guesses but I guessed wrong. The mount holes on the tv are not in the center they are on the bottom! So there ya go now you know if the same thing happens to you mount about 8 inches lower (if you got the 55).Next problem was VLC and winamp on my pc. They are not supported by 4k or should I say the high resolution that comes with 4k. Ive tried using the scaling feature in win10 but it didnt look right to me. So the buttons in a few programs go whacky (tiny very tiny). Hopefully the applications update soon (weird considering how long 4k has been out) but it doesnt stop them from working they are just ridiculously tiny. Movies are fine still in vlc but hitting play/pause is hard when the keyboard isnt near me. I messed with settings and googled a little bit i might find the solution after it bugs me a little more.I spend some time in video games. Player unknown BG looks great but ever since I got this tv my mouse is not registering all the clicks Its so annoying! Random buttons just go dead then come back. I had to moved my desk 5 feet back because of the size of this tv Im thinking its that but its a really nice mouse and im only 8 feet away from pc! changed the batteries too! So be ready for that hopefully you have better luck.Then I tried out overwatch. I have a modest home built pc. 8 gigs of ram getting 8 more soon. Fresh install of windows. 6gb video card. Decent amd processor. Still though I think my gpu is having trouble keeping up with this tv and its crazy resolution. I got this tv because of the 120hz never had that before. Instead of noticing a positive difference Ive dropped down to 20fps (pretty much unplayable) but boy does it look beautiful. So if youre going to use this for video games on a pc be ready to start upgrading and tweaking with stuff. Im sure a reformat some more ram and some tweaking will fix it i only booted it up and tested overwatch for a few minutes.ok so here comes the boring part where i praise this tv for an entire paragraph. fantastic tv. it went out of stock then came back for $400 55 inch 4k tv for 400??? what world is this? I am not made of money and $400 is a lot to me so thank you TCL for making such an amazing tv for people with small budgets. I went from a 32 inch off brand 1080p tv to this behemoth and the difference is night and day. Ive never had roku before but the free channels/youtube/weather whatever is just amazing. I cant believe it to be honest i feel like a 90 year old person seeing a cell phone for the first time (and im no stranger to technology) but my budget has always steered me towards cheaper TV's. Color is fantastic picture all of it so vivid! If youre on the fence about this tv they are usually on display at walmart  so go check it out! It was about 2 years ago when i saw a tcl at walmart and I knew Id own a TCL someday its so obvious when you compare the picture of this tv to any of the big name brand tv's in walmart  then you factor in the price and there is no competition for this tv. Also like others said the remote is awesome and a spare is under $10 ordering 2 more! Love it. Buy this tv!","positive"
"This is a great TV for the price","Love it!  It's easy to switch between cable antenna Blue Ray player and Roku streaming apps.  This has a much better picture than I expected after reading some of the reviews. The 4K picture is amazing but there is not a lot of 4K content out there yet (add the Roku 4K channel to see for yourself).  This displays regular HD content just fine.It has some nice features like the ability to pause live TV and using your phone as a Roku remote with the free Roku app from the play store.  I was leery of not having a remote with numbers on it but the ROKU remote works very seamlessly. I already had Netflix and Hulu but there are many good free Roku channels worth downloading. Roku is free just sign up for a free account and start adding streaming channels. This TV does not support channel numbers so save your money on a universal remote. I have cable too so when I switch to the cable box I can use the remote that came with it to change channels or scroll with the Roku remote.  The sound is also surprisingly good but I already had a sound bar but don't really require one now.All in all this was a great purchase and we are extremely satisfied with the TCL 55-inch 4K Roku Smart TV.","positive"

"TCL - Best bang for your buck","I've never heard of TCL before I purchased this TV when I asked people I knew who were TV fanatics they all seemed fair to midland on the quality.  I needed a new bedroom TV that had smart functions such as hulu and Netflix and Playstation Vue so having roku built in was going to be very convenient.  The setup was easy just attach the legs to the bottom of the TV with 2 screws each.  It is a bit wobbly if pushed but it seems sturdy enough.  Setting up the TV itself was fast it does ask you to connect or setup your Roku account which took just a few mins.  It will even ask you to plug in your existing equipment (cable box game systems amazon fire tv etc) into the HDMI ports and allow you to tell it what each hdmi port has connected.The picture quality is amazing for a 300-400 dollar 4k HDR tv.  To be honest it looks better than my 4k Sony LED TV I bought from magnolia.  There is some light bleed in the corners not anything that bothers me to much but the blacks and deep and colors are vibrant.  Since this is a Roku TV everything is integrated together and that alone can cause some quirks and/or annoyances.  The controller is small and it is very easy to press the wrong button  If you hit the * button or back button it takes you to the selection screen for apps. Also the volume control and mute button are on the right side of the controller I am constantly hitting mute or changing the volume when trying to navigate the apps again just a small annoyance and by no means takes away from the amazement I have with my purchase.So if you are on the fence on buying a TCL TV I say go for it.  It makes a great bedroom TV and honestly it would be a great living room TV.","positive"
"Wonderful TV!","This is a wonderful TV. The first one that came had a cracked screen and Amazon replaced it immediately! (thanks!). This TV (55) is really huge and the picture quality in my honest opinion is very clear. Please note if you use cable I noticed yesterday when trying the cable channels almost all the channels are HD 1080. So you may not see any difference in the picture quality (except that the screen might be much larger) in the cable channels (e.g. CNNHD). But there are many movies and also Youtube clips that are in 4K and you can really enjoy them. What I noticed is that even 1080 provides a good quality for my eyes. I could hardly notice if a picture is 1080 or 4K but I can tell you the 4K quality seemed just to be very real. Given the largeness of the screen you could think you were there in person (something you can't possibly feel with 1080). The Ruko environment is wonderfully easy (I already had a Roku account from the past). For its price I think this TV is a bargain. Overall my previous TV (LG 42 3D HD) was already really good so I was in doubt whether paying an extra $400+ (price and tax) would justify but now I can see it was worth. It's like having a small-scale movie theatre in your home. Lastly I read among the reviews (before buying the TV) that some people had complained about the TV's speaker (so I had thought I needed also to buy a separate speaker!). Honestly I find the speakers really awesome! I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about. I agree it is not the best speaker you may see but I find the sound quality and volume to be really good (note: I am only an ordinary use not a tech savvy who can distinguish microscopic differences). Overall if you are looking for a 4K TV and not very expensive I strongly recommend that look at this TV very closely before considering anything else. I have found it a really good TV.","positive"

"Awesome entry level 4K TV","This is my first 4K TV and I gotta say having the built in Roku is pretty awesome!  I am a big believer in IP TV so this seamlessly worked with Netflix (to get 4K from Netflix you need to pay an extra $2.00 a month) Hulu HBO Now and Amazon Video.  I haven't tried Crunchyroll yet to see how that experience is.  The built in speakers are just okay so I bought a Soundbar TaoTronics Sound Bar Wired and Wireless Bluetooth Audio ( 40 Watt Speaker34-Inch 2 Passive Radiators Dual Connection Methods Touch and Remote Control Wall Mountable Updated Version) which I then connected to the TV using an optical cable AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters).","positive"
"So far so great!","I've read mixed reviews on here but they're pretty good overwhelmingly.So like you I'm sure I'm sick of the this is the best! or the don't buy this garbage! reviews. I'm gonna lay out the truth (IMHO) in pros and cons.Pros:- for the money it's a great TV- if you're in the Roku system already it's a breeze setting it up- beautiful picture- decent enough built in audio- cool extra thumb drive/live tv pause/rewind feature- good specs- there's surprisingly alot of 4k streaming content if you have the bandwidth for it.Cons:- it's not a $3000 picture for this price (but duh)- if you've not used Roku it's pretty differentSo those are the facts. I didn't get a free TV. I did some research and had a very limited budget.","positive"
"Easy For Even Old Folks","I have only had the TV up for a few hours.  And to tell you the truth I did not expect to be writing a review of this TV today.  I had watch all the videos on TCL setup ratings. but I was nervous about setting up the TV on the day it arrived.My nervousness had two components our age and our physical health.  My wife is 69 and I am 66.  My wife has arthritis and I have bone-on-bone knees.  I should add that my wife weighs 120 pounds and I hit the scales at over 350.  The TV was purchased for an upstairs den.I was replacing an old Sony which was on a small TV table.  I wanted to stay with the square table so I decided to purchase a small footprint stand that could hold a 55 inch TV (plus I wanted the swivel option).  The stand came yesterday so after work (early afternoon) I decide to put the stand together  (Fitueyes Universal TV Stand).  I manage to put the main stand together backwards but that was easy to correct.The TV arrived and I was determined to get the driver to bring the TV upstairs to my den.  That was the only failure of the day.  My wife was less than excited to have a boxed TV in the entryway and with a little convincing I got her to help me push the TV up the stairs.  Now I admit the box did not instruct us to push the TV box but nor did it totally exclude that option.  So with a lot less hassle than expected we go the TV into the den.I was warned by the wife to NOT try to get the old Sony off the the table.  The Sony is very heavy and I can only stand using a cane.  She was concerned about my control over the Sony.  I agreed but did not feel her warning precluded me from putting the stand hangers on the back of the TV.With a little coaxing I was able to get my wife to help me pull the TV out of the box.  We were amazed at how easy it was for two oldies like us to pull the TV out.  We were able to leave the TV in the proper upright position to screw the hangers unto the back.  So there we were looking at the old Sony with this beautiful new TV just setting there doing nothing.We had an early dinner during which we decide to at least attempt to move the Sony.  It was tough but we did move it.  We pushed it out to the way and my wife had a few choice words about my heritage.Now the time had come to test out the stand and my job of putting it together (of course there was 15 minutes of dusting EVERYTHING in my den first).  We hoisted the TV up and it went on perfectly.  The locking screws were a little hard to get to but that was due to where we positioned the TV.We plugged in the HDMI from the X1 box and the electric cord and we were up and running.  I had never used Roku before but I had watched a lot of videos.  While the LG does have nice navigation for applications Roku seems to be a wonderful choice for the novice (and the old folks like us)The TV was turned on and I made no adjustments.  This could be due to the incredible difference between the new TCL and the old Sony or because I am a TV tuner novice.  But the picture looked great straight out of the box.  We started with the Roku setup and got the cable box and internet going.  For now it is wireless but I may change it over to wired tomorrow.Once setup was done we went to the Roku channels (we had never seen them before - nice variety).  We then went to Netflix YouTube etc.)  I also download the Roku phone app since most of my late night viewing will be using sound thru my phone into my Bluetooth/wired headphones.Finally we set up the cable and wand.  The wand does not seem to replace the TCL wand but that could be my lack of investigation on the subject.At this point I thought we were done.  The TV is up and running and we have few issues related to the TV or stand.  But then it happened.  By wife looked at the TV in my den looked at the TV in her office looked at the TV in my den again and proclaimed We need to switch TV's or you need to place another order tonight..I love my wife but the heck if I am going to give up the first new TV I have had in over 20 years.  I always get the hand-me-downs always.  So since she does stream higher quality content than I do I think I will order a TCL 6 series (65) and I will let her review that TV.In summary for the price I would rate the TCL 55 405 perfect for my situation.  And I must also highly rate the TV stand I purchased (the swivel is fantastic and the wide legs included with the TV were not practical for my situation).  Both were very easy to assemble/setup even for older folks like us.","positive"
"So far it's a solid winner.","Bought Nov. 5 2017.So far this TV's picture sound quality remote and Roku experience have all been above expectation.  So far there is not one bad thing I can say about this TV.  This is my honest review.  Nobody is bribing me to utter one word.  Wish they were but nothing...  I've noticed other manufacturers are selling comparable TV's at this price so I don't know how this one stacks up to the new offerings elsewhere.  But all I can tell you is the one I received is a solid win so far.  I will update if something goes on the fritz...  Hope this helps you make a decision.Purchased a WALI Table Top TV Stand for Most 22-65 LCD... with this TV and it works extremely well very sturdy and allows you to put this TV on a much smaller table.","positive"

"2017 Model with HDR Fast Apps Awesome Features and Great Price","I'm really happy with this TV. I don't write reviews often but this TV deserves it. It's the summer 2017 model so it has HDR now which gives you a more vibrant dynamic color range as well as better black levels. I've used it for about a week now and TV shows like Gotham do a great job showing how well the HDR handles dark scenes. I've played upscaled PS3 games PS4 games at 1080p look stunning I look forward to trying an Xbox One X on it. My only complaint is that the 4K videos on Youtube can supposedly work but if I bring up the Stats for Nerds it shows that Optimal Resolution is 3840x2160 but the best it'll stream at is 1920x1080 even with a full 60 seconds of buffer. I'm only on 20 meg DSL but with that good of a buffer the 4K should work. Any help on that TCL? As far as picture quality it's fantastic. I've seen models for double the price that aren't much better. The text is so sharp I can't see individual pixels even from my 3 foot viewing distance in bed. Brightness levels are very high I had to put it in Dark mode for nighttime viewing. Colors are very vibrant and can be customized I dropped the Contrast and Saturation from 100 to 90 and like that look.I like that I save money on power not having to use my PS4 for my 5 streaming services: Hulu Netflix Amazon Video Youtube and best of all Plex. I'm amazed at how fast I can switch apps even faster than PS4! And on top of it all I love the Roku app and how I can control the TV from spots where the remote doesn't work and I can use headphones to listed to loud stuff late at night and not bother roommates very cool. This TV will hold me over until the 4K projectors start getting down to the sub-$2K range in the next year or two. I'm now considering buying a second of these TVs for the garage so I can watch TV while I hit the treadmill.","positive"
"Great TV for the Price. Not the best gaming monitor. Maxed at 30 Hz","Very impressed with how nice of a TV you can get for such a cheap price. I went with the 55 and am loving it. It's very convenient to use the app on my phone and change the volume or channel without having to get off the couch and find the remote. There is also a feature that allows you to change the audio to your phone which I found nice for when I was watching football and then went to the kitchen to whoop up a quick snack.  I was able to leave the room and still hear what was going on through my phone as to not miss a play. The only things I would like to see improved is that the audio feature doesn't work with HDMI inputs and I would like to have it work with my computers audio and that it says 120hz refresh rate but when using it on my computer with a 980 GTX graphics card it wouldn't only allow for 60hz and even then it wouldn't display. Maxed out at 30hz while maintaining visibility.","positive"
"Exceptional Value","OK. I am going to give this TV 5 stars for now. But I've only had it for a month so I can't comment on long-term durability/dependability. I am stunned by the value here. For the price I was ready to be disappointed but this is a really first class user experience. I did not try to mount my TV. I just used the included legs to put it on my entertainment console. Set up was a breeze....much easier than the more expensive brand-name sets I have owned. The illumination seems even and is sufficiently bright. I am not an expert on black levels etc. The blacks look black to me and the picture in general is as good as my other set from a a better known brand (which cost $1500). I really like the integration of streaming services. I know other brands do this but TCL has done a great job. With the exception of Apple TV I have all of my services in one place.....and I could of course add Apple TV as an external device. Kudos to TCL for whatever they are doing.....jamming this much goodness into their sets at a great price.","positive"
"Great TV","Amazed at the quality of this 49 tv. Replaced a name brand and found this picture far superior. FWIW I am very critical of my electronic equipment and if you take the time to set it up properly you will love it. Never used the Roki interface before and must admit it took a couple of days to fully grasp it's peculiarities.  No big deal. I am 80 years old and did it; so can you if you want to.","positive"
"Huge upgrade from 10yo LCD tech","There are numerous reviews about this TV for you to read on the Internet - Rtings being very thorough for your average Joe. Here's my non-technical review in upgrading from a nearly 10-year old Samsung fluorescent-lit LCD TV.Compared to the old TV* Blacks are deeper and more even* Colors are more vibrant even without actual HDR or WCG* 4K content looks amazing but 1080 content looks natural (no issues with fuzziness/blurriness)* Weighs far less due to being significantly thinnerThe other TVs I considered were the 2017 Vizio M-series and TCL P-series TVs. After considering how we use TV (fairly infrequently - mostly streaming YT OANN Plex Amazon Vid etc.) and the cost difference for HDR WCG and FALD (AND upgrading to a 4K receiver + player) I decided to go with the inexpensive route. Honestly the tech has improved so much even at the low-end that my eyes are impressed and I haven't noticed what I'm missing. Maybe in a couple more years we'll upgrade our entire setup and move this TV to the bedroom but if you're like me coming from a dinosaur of an LCD TV the comparative upgrade is gigantic; I'd bet even TVs from 3-5 years ago might look poor next to this.","positive"
"Don’t Brother Reading Any More Reviews Just BUY This TV","Amazing picture and easy easy easy remote even wife figured out the remote haha ..... This is the BEST BANG for your Buck and you’ll love the ease of setup and quality of the picture. We cut the cable cord and now enjoy TV using just our WiFi Signal - Killer Deal as I was paying over $100 month for just TV and now zero dollars although we may subscribe to Sling and already are Amazon Prime Members so that adds some to monthly TV expense but man oh man are we glad we got this TV Love it! Oh forgot we have the 65” 2017 Model.","positive"
"GREAT Value - Aceptable performance","This is a GREAT bargain.I was going to complain about this TV.  However after going through all of the settings I now am very happy.The default video settings were FAR to bright.  I had to adjust brightness down and reduce the backlight level to near zero to achieve decent contrast and performance.  I discovered that uniformity varies with tilt.  Keep it flat if you want best performance.  Tilting the TV by 15 degrees using a wall mount like I did can produce backlight distortion at the corners.  Not terrible but noticeable in a dark room.Compared to my LG OLED B7 this TCL is not a reference monitor but gets the job done.  Both 1080p and 4K video quality are good.The sound is some of the loudest I have ever heard through a flat screen TV.  Theater mode sounded best in my opinion.  It does not have a ton of bass but can get everything else annoyingly loud without distortion.The Roku features work well.  Some menus were a bit slow but perfectly acceptable.I still can't believe the price of this TV.","positive"
"I Should Have Made A Twice As Nice Purchase When I Had The Chance!","Based on the reviews (here at Amazon as well as at other retailers such as Walmart & BestBuy) I recently purchased --sight unseen-- one of the 49 models of this TV for our condo in Wilmington (NC) at the holiday price of $269.99 (it's $319.99 now).Had I known for certain at the time of purchase how great this product actually is I would have definitely purchased 2 of them --the other unit being targeted for our condo in Stuart (FL).A 4k/Ultra HD 49 Smart TV with a 120Hz refresh rate automatic up-scaling from 720p/1080i/1080p/2160p and the equivalent of a built-in Roku Ultra Digital Video Player built-in --for $269.99!How could you possibly go wrong? Even at the current $319.99 price I will very likely buy another one of these great TV's.So far I am very satisfied and unlike for most of my purchases I added the --very reasonably priced-- $21.49 Four Square (Allstate) extended warranty (4 years). $5.37/year is a very small price to pay for 4 years of peace of mind!By the way my not-so tech savvy wife loves the simplicity of using the Roku remote control for all viewing.She and I primarily view content on Netflix Amazon Prime and the new Spectrum TV Choice channel: ~$24.00/month for ~15 HD versions of your live local TV networks plus 10 selections (of your choice) from a list of ~50 live cable channels (AMC FS1 HGTV MSNBC TBS USA etc.) plus ~45 music channels.I'll update this review if things change but for now I consider this to be one of the best deals ever.C.H.

"Best TV I've ever owned at the best price I've ever paid.","Best bang for your buck on a 4K tv! I love this television and I certainly loved the price. With other smart TVs often feeling frustrating with complicated menu systems and sluggish operation – this smart TV runs Roku OS. The best streaming platform makes this television a joy to use. Offering compatibility with 4K at 60hz and 12bit color depth the picture is beautiful! Here’s a list of pros and cons:Pros:*Great looking design and slim. Not too over or understated looks great in my living room.*Individual input picture settings – this TV remembers settings such as brightness and contrast and even game mode for each input setting. No longer will you need to turn game mode off and on between devices.*Fast – turns on nearly instantly and launches apps incredibly quickly. No waiting!*Great networking compatibility – with compatibility for 2.4 and 5.0 GHZ wireless and a built in ethernet port it’s easy to find a solution to keep streaming uninterrupted.*Plenty of inputs and outputs – 3 HDMI ports 1 USB port 1 antenna / cable connector 1 digital optical audio out 1 AV In 1 Ethernet port. All you need for cable game consoles and the like.*Simple and easy to hold remote – with volume rocker on the side just like your phone and just the right amount of buttons this remote is easy to hold and easy to use.*Great looking picture – for the price I’ve never seen a TV look so good.*Great speakers – I was considering buying a sound bar before it arrived but having used it for over three months I don’t think I need one. The speakers sound great and can be very loud if needed.Cons:*Remote is not wireless it’s IR – you have to point the remote at the TV to use it. A small inconvenience as compared to other Roku streaming stick or boxes.","positive"
"Amazing Deal one should think hard before passing it up.","I was in the market for a new larger TV for my Girlfriends house where I spend 2-3 days a week. Last week I was sitting on her couch and searched for 55 inch TV's on Amazon and this TCL TV Showed up for only $369 and it was 4k too!! .. I thought that's a great price. So I researched it.The ScreenThe screen does have some black-light bleed along the left side. It's not noticeable unless the screen is displaying a black picture. I was expecting a little bit of it. Given the price of the TV it doesn't bother me and it's not noticeable any other time.It's also pretty reflective. I thought the reflection might be more of a problem than it is. There is a window that the TV is pointing at but the reflection isn't bothering me as much as i thought it would.*update*It's now 1:05pm and the reflection is starting to become more apparent then in the morning when I took those photosSo far i've been very pleased with the Roku OS it's VERY snappy and fluid. Netflix loads quick and the program guide is both fluid and attractive. Some User interfaces of some cheap tv's lag alot are aren't very smooth. Hell even my 70 inch LG TV from 2013 isn't very smooth. This Roku TV UI is butter smooth! The Roku OS also has a lot of settings to set as well if you want to dive in. The Roku TV does not recognize NTFS file formats. The Roku Media player does play flies off Fat32 USB but apparently files with DTS audio have no sound. So I downloaded Emby and installed the  Emby on the intel Celeron Nuc I put next to her TV a while back. Now I can access TV shows and movies off a USB hard drive I have plugged into the system. The 4k demo content i downloaded played fine off the fat32 USB stick (they were only 600 - 1gb files) but played like crap over emby probably due to the low specs of the nuc all other 1080 content played fine. One neat feature is the Roku Android app which also acts as a remote control. On the app there is also a headphone button. When you press it the audio on the TV gets muted and audio then starts playing on the smart phone. So the person next to you could wear headphones. Because it runs the Roku OS it also has other Roku features you would expect such as searching for movies and seeing which services have them.There is a Over the air program guide built into the TV and a nice smooth attractive and responsive one that at that. The TV also allows you to plug in a USB flash drive allowing you to pause TV for up to 90 mins. When you change channel it also starts a buffer allowing you to also rewind TV. All in all i'm very happy with this cheap 55 inch TV. Compared to what she had this is a night and day difference. I also love the built in Roku OS. A new version came out recently version 8.0 so the TV is also getting updates which is also nice.","positive"
"Fantastic if it lasts","Fantastic bargain for a 55-inch 4K TV. Light-weight and easy to set up. The only problem I had was getting the Roku stuff to play thru my receiver. There is sparse documentation but a lot of googling and experimentation finally got me what I needed. It turns out you have to connect the HDMI cable to the HDMI 1 input which is labeled ARC; that's the audio return channel connection. The other end needs to go into an ARC monitor port on the receiver. My Onkyo has main and sub monitor ports and only the main one is compatible (the other goes to my projector so it doesn't matter). I then had to turn on the RIHD function in my receiver settings. Along the way I set the TV to not play audio thru its own speakers.The only other negative is that the TV has two well-spaced feet instead of a central stand so it won't rotate at all and you can't even buy a swivel stand for it because the feet are 38 apart. I may have to buy a universal back-mounted stand that swivels.In terms of color and brightness it's terrific. I hooked it up to my computer and it's a fantastic computer monitor. It even works beautifully in the vertical position (IPS panel I assume).","positive"
"I consistently have been annoyed. Even after changing tv settings","I'm blown away by this tv. First off viewing 4k for the first time (outside of a BestBuy) and I'm smitten. I threw on a documentary on Colombia from Netflix and you could see every strand of hair on a jaguars fur.Most importantly color accuracy was phenomenal. I've got friends with LCD OLED QLED HDTV's and as a photographer I'll often connect my laptop via HDMI to show of photos. I consistently have been annoyed. Even after changing tv settings my photos are either oversaturated not saturated enough or can't accurately display a gradual fade to dark areas.Well this tv has passed my tests in flying colors. I tried numerous images of mine and each time they were more than adequately displayed.Now I suddenly don't want to leave my house.","positive"
"Incredible","I was a bit worried about purchasing this item after reading some of the reviews but I am glad to see the worry was misplaced. This television is indeed very good.The original arrival date was Thursday but it showed on Wednesday which is always impressive. The box does detail what's inside so I caution buyers to use discrete packaging if you live in a bad neighborhood.Like another reviewer I was not prepared for the sheer size of this television. It is quite big even if you're used to a 50 inch television. The television itself isn't necessarily heavy but carrying 55 inches can be awkward. Everything you need except a screw driver is neatly packaged inside for you. Set up is easy just screw the screws into the stands and you're ready to go. It doesn't feel cheap which is nice.The remote is small but the television does have the option of downloading an app on your phone to use in case you lose it. It can be a tad slow to respond if you don't have it pointed directly at the LED but otherwise it's easy to use. The volume buttons are a bit awkward as they're on the side of remote. I'm new to Roku televisions so this may be a common feature.After that you simply follow directions on screen to get started easily remove any content you don't desire download any you want and ta da! Finished.","positive"
"Best TV I ever bought.","Got this TV for my 72 year old mother. She is hard to hear so the large text on bottom of display is awesome. The Roku built in is a no brainier for her. She used to never watch Amazon video or Netflix until now. She loves it. I would love to see somebody create a Facebook easy to use interface for web TV for the elderly to use to see the grandkids and use the simplified remote to scroll through the app. One can dream can't they?","positive"
"Great TV for an unbelievable price.","Like everyone else I was a bit leery of a 55 4K TV at this price but decided to take the gamble based on the excellent reviews.  And I'm very glad I did.  My only complaint is that it took a bit longer to arrive than planned - maybe a week beyond the last estimated delivery date but it was worth the wait.  It arrived from Amazon (which is great because I don't have a pickup and it's too big to fit in the car) and all I had to do was attach the two feet (the screws are very long I'd recommend a drill with a screwdriver bit).  It walks you through the setup you enter your router password - and it actually allows you to see what you've typed in so you can double-check it before hitting enter - a welcome feature these days.  Then you can go into Netflix and enter your password your Amazon streaming etc.  You plug your devices in and choose a description for each (Blu ray player game console etc.) and that's about it.I've been using it for a few weeks now mostly with Blu Rays (I only have one 4K movie) via my Philips BDP7501 4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray Player with Wi-Fi I've noticed no dead pixels or any other problems.  Picture quality is excellent overall.  HD TV looks pretty good though of course nowhere near the quality of Blu rays but watching golf on this big screen it looks like you can walk right down the fairway from your living room.  My one 4K movie (Alien Covenant) looked spectacular.For a remote control you get one of those Roku remotes it has a very limited number of buttons on it and you'll need to keep your cable box remote and Blu ray remote or of course program everything into a universal remote.  But the little Roku remote works fine for Netflix and Amazon streaming and controlling all the TV menus.There are plenty of picture and sound settings and I believe it also outputs HDMI audio to a surround sound receiver.  When I first got the TV I didn't yet have my Blu ray player so I plugged the old DVD player into the back of it via the old red white and yellow RCA cables and the picture quality was fine. It doesn't have audio output via the old red and white RCA cables so right now I've got it hooked up to my 2-channel non-surround sound receiver via an adapter cable which splits the headphone output (1/8 connector) into the regular red and white RCA connectors.  The sound from the TV itself was surprisingly good my receiver and two small tower speakers just add more bass but other than that I'd have to say the TV speakers sounded almost as good.Overall I couldn't be happier.  Excellent picture quality huge screen and an unbelievable price.  I'd recommend this TV highly.","positive"
"buy it.. i wish they made it in 80 inch as well","I've always skeptical of cheap stuff... But they offered a 4 year warrenty for like 35 bucks.. heres the deal. I'm not looking at it beside 10 other tvs so I can't really speak to picture quality. looks good to my eyes. cant see lag.. cant see any wierdness. What I'm impressed with besides the price Is the interface. I'm a bit of a cord cutter. no point in buying 125 buck of programing and only watching 3 channels. the over the air interface Is great. the Roku built in is awesome. you can pause live tv for about 90 seconds...I'm not sure why we haven't seen this combo until now. samsung and the other giants spend 100 of thousands developing interfaces.. guess what tcl... this is what we want. I can control it with my cell when I can't find the remote. the thing is pretty awesome. I  honestly like it much better than my 80 Vizeo. Durability I can't speak to.. But for less than 10 bucks a year they will send someone out to the house fix it where it sits or replace it. so max out of pocket is 110 bucks a year.. try that math with the 3k dollar vizio that has a dark spot 3 years old and outside the warrenty. this is the deal.. buy it with the warrenty and dont look back.. these guys talking about broken on arrival.. thats true of any tv. i bought 3 curved samsungs to use as monitors last year out of 3 2 were broke. out of the 2 sent to replace those 1 was broken. dont sweat that stuff.. just send it back and get another. this is a soild buy.","positive"
"Definitely Worth The Buy","Coming from a 1080p Samsung TV I wasn't really sure what to expect when I switched over to this relatively low-budget 4K set. I've had the TV for little over two weeks now and I have to say that I'm pretty impressed. The picture quality straight out of the box isn't the best with way too much oversaturated colors and an ugly level of sharpness. But when calibrated (Roku TVs don't have a lot of settings particular to picture quality and the more advanced settings like white balance and gamma are reserved to the companion app) it looks pretty stunning. I've had no issues with the TV in terms of shipping management nothing damaged or otherwise defective. The only downside is that there is substantial backlight bleed on the edges of the screen but it isn't obtrusive and it's something that can easily be gotten used to. I also want to talk about the Roku elements of the TV. Everything works well there's no visible hiccups and there is no remote lag (although it's extremely particular as to where you aim the remote) which compared to my last Smart TV is pretty great. I do have one gripe with the Roku apps though with Netflix in particular. Many of the apps look to be running at a pretty low resolution and look relatively ugly with even highly compressed thumbnails. Even the subtitles in Netflix are pretty aliased. This isn't a big problem though as it's only a nitpick. Despite this the apps that I've tested for 4K streaming Netflix Hulu and Vudu are all fully capable of streaming 4K which the TV itself handles well. If you're not looking to buy and ultra expensive 4K set this will absolutely suit your needs for a proper 4K HDR experience.","positive"
"Absolutely amazing TV","I selected this TV by going to Amazon and selecting TVs under $500 sorted by customer reviews. This TV has over 3000 reviews with an average rating of 4.5 stars so it seemed like a safe bet. So far I am not at all disappointed.The picture quality is outstanding. I'm a stickler for image quality - just having a 4K (3840x2160) display isn't enough to wow me. I want a ton of brightness good black levels high color saturation and a good response time. This TV has all of that. With other TVs I've always spent about an hour tweaking and fine tuning the settings to get the picture just how I like it but with this set there was minimal setup needed. It was pretty much good to go out of the box.The built-in Roku functionality is great too. Not only do you get the standard suite of Roku apps like Amazon Prime Video Netflix et al. but with Plex I can stream media directly from my PC. As well it's a piece of cake to cast videos from my Android phone or mirror my laptop display with Windows 10. Even with absolutely nothing hooked up to this TV I still have a ton of content to watch.One concern I had was the scaling; With 4K content still being somewhat scarce I knew that the majority of the content I would be watching/playing would be at 1080p. Thankfully 1080p still looks fantastic on this display. I haven't played any games on it yet (I'll update my review once I do) but movies look crisp and nicely detailed with no noticeable blurring.** Update: I promised to update once I had a chance to try out some games and now that I have I am very impressed. By enabling Game Mode and using the mobile app to disable Noise Reduction this thing is effectively a gigantic computer monitor. No ghosting or noticeable input lag this thing is perfect for gaming on. I have my PC connected and I'm even able to play games with HDR support like Far Cry 5 and Resident Evil 7 after connecting an HDMI 2.0 cable.For the price this TV is an absolute steal.","positive"
"GET THIS TV! Best value for anyone and a good as any high priced TV I have seen. ROKU is GREAT!","I was nervous about ordering this TV reading other reviews. There was no reason to be. This TV far surpassed my expectations and my wife and I love it. The sound from the TV is not bad and I hooked it up to my home theater amplifier. Nothing about this TV is poor quality and I find it to be very high quality. Installed on a support on the wall and looks very nice. The smart phone android application works great. I have Netflix and Amazon Video and I like the navigation on this better than the web interfaces for those two channels. All I can say is I am more than happy. I actually was going to get a smaller TV at 1080 resolution but the deal on this one was so good I moved my 50 Westinghouse 4K Smart TV to the bedroom. My named brand Westinghouse is junk compared to this TV. I like it better than Sony TVs and is as good as any Samsung I have seen but you save so much money. I do not even see a reason to buy any other TV. We use this in an room and is about 12' from the TV and is a very good size.PROS - Great quality picture ROKU is great easy to use interface and remote. Simple setup Super priceCons - NONE","positive"
"Just the best for the money","Just the best for the money has done everything I️ ask it to. Perfect for a giant external 4K monitor for my Mac. GREAT for gaming. But hands down the best part is the UI so smooth so responsive I️ never have the lag problems I️ have seen in my much more expensive Samsung UHD TV. My only complaints are: the indicator light at the bottom of the TV a little annoying but whatever; the remote is a little cheap but it works great and is super simple; obviously the complaints about the TV not being quite as bright as other way more expensive panels will be true but I️ haven’t noticed it too much the picture quality is amazing. If you are looking for a 4K tv and don’t want to spend a fortune you are getting an extremely high quality product here for an insanely low price. This is my favorite thing I️ have purchased in a long time.","positive"
"LOVE MY TCL ROKU HDR HD TV!!!!!","I am in heaven. Wow. What a great TV. I was a little apprehensive about the set-up. But when it arrived l just got busy unpacking it and hoped for the best. It was a breeze to set up and get my apps logged into Roku and a few minor adjustments to the picture and l was set. Spectacular color and the sound quality is off the charts. Why would anyone need better sound? For my budget this TCL HDR TV is the bomb. Don't be fooled by all the high class brands and perks they advertise to reel in your dollars this TV can compete with them all. Legit.","positive"
"A great tv for a low price.","At this price if you're in the market for a tv of this size why would you not get this one?  Judging by the reviews there's a small chance you could end up with a bad one but the overall consensus is this is a great tv for the price. I'm not sure smart tv's existed before we got our last tv (a 42 Sylvania).  Watching tv on this one I feel like we have been living in the dark ages.  I'm not a huge videophile or audiophile but I do enjoy good video and audio and this tv certainly has both.  I haven't had it for a week yet and I will be back if things change but this tv has done everything very well.  Netflix Hulu Directv Now Amazon and Roku TV have all worked flawlessly.  I just finished watching Dr. Strange on this tv.  Holy cow.  Amazing.  Considering there are tv's out there that cost hundreds or thousands more I am very happy with my purchase.","positive"
"Impressive at twice the price","Truly impressive television at twice the price. I've had several Name Brand TV's in the past and I had a small bit of hesitation about buying my first TCL but this TV has put all those hesitations to rest. The screen is hands down the best I've seen bright and crystal clear. The ROKU software is lightning fast and functions perfectly. If I had to choose anything I didn't like I'd have to say the remote is small and could easily be lost. If you're contemplating buying a TCL and having reservations take the leap you won't be disappointed. Highly recommended product.","positive"
"BEST TV on the market today! 10 stars!","This is the BEST smart tv on the market for this price. I am so impressed with this tv and the smart features.  It’s EASY FAST and it WORKS!  I have had Samsung and LG TV’s and I regret buying both of those.  Both Samsung and LG TVs stopped working for no reason after 2 years.  This TV is replacing my broke LG.  I just hope this one lasts longer than 2 years but at the price less than a smartphone it’s hard to just replace it with the most recent tv technology on the market.","positive"
"Great TV","Update: We have now had this TV for a month and a half. The only issue I have is that I try to talk to it like my fire stick and shut it off. Love the smart TV features. Sound is fine and picture is fine. This is a purchase I do not regret but also realize we don't watch a ton of TV in our house and we are not looking for that perfect picture of something like an OLED. The only thing I wish is that I would have went ahead and bought maybe a 60 in because of the space in my entertainment center. Would not hesitate to buy this again.If you are someone that wants an inexpensive TV this is great. Don't expect the picture to be like an OLED but you are not paying that kind of money. The picture is good. We watch between 0 and 3 hours of TV a week so this was a great price. We only use a digital antenna so the picture there isn't the best but when I put on Netflix Hulu or Prime we get a great pic.The only thing that I don't care for are the leg but that is just a preference on looks.This was also the first smart TV for us and I really like the Roku features. The best part is when I try to use voice command like on my Fire Stick then realize that it doesn't have that feature.This was super easy to get connected to the wifi and I like the menu.","positive"
"So much better than it should be for the price.","I'll be honest I expected this TV to be mediocre at best. I've had experience with TCL in the past and have been happy every time but a good 4K TV with Roku for under $3XX seemed absurd. I expected at the very least for the Roku integration to be slow and cumbersome.I could not be happier to have been wrong. The picture quality is great. Not the best I've ever seen but for the price I don't think you can really do better. It's certainly much better than half as good as TVs that cost twice as much or more.The Roku is fast and responsive. It works well. It wouldn't kill them to add a .com button to the on-screen keyboard for entering e-mails but that's not a big deal. The remote is small. I would prefer a bigger universal remote to program it to work with my cable and other devices but that is also no a big deal. I'll just have to get a universal remote that works with the TV instead.Installation was easy though I didn't love the way the HDMI inputs were laid out. You'll be well-served to use cables without large heads.Overall I am very happy with this TV so far.","positive"
"Optical out does 5.1 audio","We're very happy with this TV. The picture is very clear with great colors and black levels at least to my non-expert eye. The TV tuner is very good - we're using the same antenna in the same spot for OTA broadcasts and haven't experienced the drop outs which were common with our old TV.Two things I'd note in particular:The weak spot for most less expensive TV's is the on-screen UI and remote are garbage. The Roku interface and remote makes this the best TV UI experience I've ever had. I was worried that it would be stuck with an old Roku version or that the on-board CPU would be slow but it seems up to date (the first thing it did after plugging it in was pull a Roku update down) and the interface is just as fast as our top of the line Roku 3. Other members of my family who often need training with new AV equipment and remotes needed no help whatsoever.The other thing I'd add is the audio optical out does 5.1 output. On a lot of TV's you'll have optical out that only does stereo but this isn't the case here. OTA and Roku channels are getting 5.1 audio output over optical. Even Dolby Digital+ (Netflix et al) is properly transcoded to 5.1. This is a huge benefit if you have older surround sound equipment.I high recommend this TV.","positive"
"did this really cost me less that $700?","I am astounded by this tv.  I do not understand 9/10ths of what it can really do for an expert taking it on a joy ride around the park but right out of the box it does everything I want it to do and better than I hoped it would.also get over the whining about the speakers.  they are perfect for a 20'x20' living room.  I guess they would not please mick jagger as a display of a stones performance to a full crowd in shea stadium tho.  lolone last thing if any of tech experts out there wants to contact me with the ask the reviewer a question but instead tell me which hdmi port will give me best picture from my dish box I by all means would be grateful for you expert advice.","positive"
"4K hdr 55 inch tv","This tv has all the modern features: 4K hdr Roku 3 hdmi ports 90 minutes of channel recording with your 16gb usb flash drive inserted. The size is great you have cinema experience at home. Sound quality in theater mode is fantastic. You get a lot of tv for small amount of money. Definitely it is the most interesting tv on the market for me.","positive"
"The Roku operating system is amazing and the Resolution and Brightness are great for the $","This TV has excellent resolution and brightness.  The speakers are loud enough and a sound bar connection is easy.  Three HDMI outputs is great and one of them is the 'High Powered HDMI that you can use for 4k gaming.  The case is attractive and the bezel and feet work well it can be wall mounted. The absolute standout on this TV is the operating system. The Roku operating system is very smooth and really well set up for the way I consume media now.  It seamlessly blends streaming services antenna blue-ray and USB media.  The setup for my Antenna was very easy and being able to have a channel guide and info integrated so seamlessly is huge.  My previous TV could not make use of the antenna like this TCL.  If you are cord cutting the Roku operating system is a must and TV has high quality fit and finish and a panel that is way above its $370 price.Best FeaturesThe remote - It is simple and its the same size as my Amazon remote.The LIVE TV Pause! with a 16gb usb you can pause live TV for up to 90 minutes.  This was previously one of the hardest parts of cord cuttingThe ability to access ALL streaming services.  Roku has deals with everyoneThe ability to listen to audio through the app.  Plug headphones into your cell phone and you can listen with the TV muted and not bother your partner.Ease of use.  This is the easiest operating system out there.  Its graphical and has shortcut buttons.If you want the absolute narrowest bezel or you need to watch TV in full blazing sun there are TV's that can achieve both for $1000+ and some even come with the Roku operating system.  For 90% of the world this TV is perfect and extremely cost effective.","positive"
"If you're looking for a great 4K Smart TV option at a bargain...","Love love love this TV. It's actually our second TCL Roku TV with us purchasing the other one about two and a half years ago. Love the experience and simplicity of both TVs. I will say that this one is actually a much better TV and Roku experience than our first one. While it hiccups and freezes occasionally this one is yet to show and sign of slowing down. Since it is newer (and it's 4K instead of 1080p like the other one) the processing and memory are much larger and faster. Loads everything effortlessly and always gives a great viewing experience. As for the actual visuals (it is a TV after all) the picture is fantastic and vibrant. I'll admit that I have very little experience with 4K televisions but I will say that it appears to be successfully upconverting everything we play though it quite nicely without any visible ghosting that I can tell from my normal sitting position. This TV is a great value. If you're looking for a great 4K Smart TV option at a bargain don't think any further - just buy it!","positive"
"Awesome TV can't beat it for the price","For the price you can't beat this TV. While it is a 4k TV the 4k content is not quite as crisp as some of the higher end models but that is ok. I wanted a TV that didn't break the bank. The picture is overall very clear and we use this sometimes to double as a computer monitor sitting about 4-5 feet away. The sound is surprisingly pretty good for a TV these days. We still plan to get a sound bar but we watch TV ~6 feet away and the sound is clear and overall works well. I actually really like the layout of the menu. I haven't used a lot of others but compared to some of the samsung menu's I think this is easier to navigate and makes more sense.I have not had any problems with WiFi as some mention. Every now and then I'll restart the TV if it doesn't connect right off but that may be the router and not the TV. I've never had problems with it dropping the connection.I have used screen mirroring with it for my phone I have a BLU phone. It worked great. There is even a way to do it just through a router (not connected to internet). You first need to connect the TV to the router when there is an internet connection then just look up how to disable network ping on the TV and your TV will stay connected to the router alone then you can use the router as an access point for screen mirroring.Overall great for the price have had it a few months now and Im very pleased. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a budget 4k smart TV","positive"
"Couldn't be happier!","Was packaged in a box then surrounded by jumbo bubble wrap and placed in another box so A+ for packaging. The TV arrived in perfect condition. The picture is as vivid and clear (if not better) as my 2016 Samsung 4k tv. You can't beat the simplicity of a built in roku interface. So much less annoying than other smart TV setups. Speakers aren't phenomenal but sound on the same par as other pricier sets. I recommend a sound bar for any and every TV though. I will be buying another or two in the future for the guest rooms.","positive"
"Best budget 4k set available for the price bar none.","I bought this TV as a housewarming present for my daughter. The first TV arrived smashed. I contacted Amazon immediately and they sent a replacement that arrived within 3 days. The replacement TV has been excellent so far. I hooked up the TV to the internet via Ethernet and went through the process of setting her up with a Roku account. Within a few minutes she was up and running and looking at a very impressive picture. I simply cannot believe the quality of this TV set for the amount of money I paid. The TV has incredible color and is plenty bright enough for her needs. I would recommend this set to anybody looking for a new TV.","positive"
"Simple Easy Awesome!","I was in the same situation as others who have reviewed this product. We have a 2 story home and a finished basement.  Prior to googles mesh system I had to have two routers to get a decent signal throughout my home.  I tried extenders but they were worthless.  I had to have several wireless networks setup.  So you would have to switch networks if you wanted a decent signal in the basement.  Once I hooked up this system I had a strong signal from top to bottom of my house.  You will notice the difference in internet speeds in my picture once I switched over to google wifi (June 14).People have complained about loss of flexibity and tweaking since they have to use their phone to configure the google network.  I have no issues with doing anything I did prior to using this.  I work from home and connect to my employer via VPN with no issues.  I can view network traffic turn off internet for the kids and see how many devices are connected at the click of a button on my phone.  No longing into the router from my desktop or my phones tiny browser.  When you walk from one level to the next I can see which google router I am connected to.  It automatically switches to the closest one as advertised.","positive"
"Google WiFi works great. I have 100 Mbps service from my ISP","Bought a new home and setup internet service. Didn't have a router so was looking to purchase one. Google WiFi works great. I have 100 Mbps service from my ISP. On WiFi using the 5 Ghz band which Google WiFi chooses automatically (it chooses between 2.4 Ghz or 5 Ghz band whichever signal is better providing you have BOTH bands available) I get full speed (speedtest.net shows 110 Mbps down 6 mbps up) as if I was on a wired connection. I was surprised because I thought I would get around 60-70 Mbps not the full speed offered. I thought I would have to get a crazy expensive gaming router with 20 antennas that looks like Sauron's helmet from Lord of the Rings to get those speeds but Google WiFi does that for $170 less and it has cool sci-fi-ish looks.Tips and advice:1. To get full WiFi speed make sure your device (PC laptop tablet phone etc.) has both 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz bands. If you don't you'll be stuck at around 30 Mbps to 70 Mbps.2. A SINGLE Google WiFi covers 1500 ft. Make sure you're within that range or get more to create a mesh network so you fall within WiFi range. My home was 1300 ft. so I only needed one.3. The Google WiFi router only has two ethernet ports one of which is used to connect to the modem. If you need more wired ports buy an ethernet switch and connect the router to the switch.4. When WiFi first connects it will likely connect you to the 2.4 Ghz band. Don't freak out. If you have a 5 Ghz band and the signal is good it will connect you within 24 hours. It connected me to 2.4 Ghz band the first time I connected for a long while but the next day when I started my PC again it was now using the 5 Ghz band.","positive"
"The Best Mesh for the Net!","This device has been a true godsend for me. I've tried Wi-Fi extenders Wireless Access Points and Powerline adapters with little to no success...and then Google Wi-Fi walked into my life. As soon as the device was announced I was ready to pick one up. Once I knew that it would be compatible with the Google OnHub I decided to pick one of them up as well to extend my wireless signal throughout our home and setup a 4 hub mesh network with OnHub and Google WiFi. So I setup the OnHub router first and added each wifi access point to our network. It was much easier than adding a wifi repeater wifi extender wifi range extender wireless repeater wireless extender or range extender. The Google WiFi app makes adding wifi points simple and easy. Just open the app select add wifi point and the app walks you through every step.Adding the wifi points to the OnHub router allows you to create a mesh network that covers your entire house while allowing your laptops smartphones tablets and other devices to seamlessly switch between the closest access point with the best signal. Google OnHub and Google WiFi points use technology called Network Assist to provide the fastest possible speed. Behind the scenes Network Assist automatically helps to avoid Wi-Fi congestion and transitions devices to the closest Wifi point for the best signal.The network is then controlled through the Google Wifi app. Use it to share the Wi-Fi password see what devices are online and prioritize them for better performance. It also has Google Wifi’s family control which allows devices on the network to be paused. The Google OnHub and Google WiFi points work together to create a strong dependable wifi network for you and your family.The attached video from our YouTube channel -Smart Home Tech- shows the step by step setup process and some speed tests.","positive"
"All the things on the internet","Ok so our old router was SUPER old.  Maybe 10 years old.  Probably anything made now is lightyears better than it.  We were having issues with it since we've added many devices over the last couple of years.  We have one three smartphones two tablets one WiFi PC a wireless printer a Google Home a Google Home mini two smart bulbs one smart plug a WII U and a Roku.  I read the router could be the problem so I bit the bullet and ordered this.I just LOVE how easy this was to set up.  Our house is a 1400sf L shape with the kitchen and dining on the short side of the L and the bedrooms on the long side.  We have the router in the living room where the cable modem and Ooma router are in the corner of the L.  I was worried that the signal would not reach my room which is the farthest but I usually get the FULL signal there.  It literally took me five minutes to set it all up.Now all of our devices are working well and I LOVE that I can shut off the wifi to devices individually (hello TEEN and PRETEEN children!) and have a separate Wifi signal for guests without having to give any passwords (the app handles it).  I wish I needed another one because that's just how cool it is.  I can't compare this to any other mesh-type systems out there but I'm completely happy with this.","positive"
"A must have if you live in a vault like me. My house is the opposite of an ...","A must have if you live in a vault like me. My house is the opposite of an open concept. In other words it has tons of walls that block Wi-Fi singles. We have blazing fast internet in the front of the house but our bedrooms are dead zones. I've tried several brands of repeaters which all have only provided marginally improved reception. I decided to give the Google WiFi system a try because I was tired of my wife nagging me about how frustrated she is with our Internet. To say that this product exceeded my expectations is an understatement. I am absolutely wowed by the results. Our Internet is now blazing fast no matter where you are in our house and we even get great reception in our garage!Installation couldn't have been easier. Just install the app on your smart phone and follow the easy directions. I had it up and running in less than 10 minutes with zero problems. The app has many cool features like being able to pause the Internet to certain devises and check the system performance in each room. The system is a little pricy but worth every penny and more.","positive"
"Google Wifi works GREAT for a NYC apartment","We live in an apartment in New York City that has solid walls that have stumped all network extenders to date. I purchased this set of 3 in the hopes of finally getting decent wifi in our bedroom and I'm very happy to report that it works! It's crazy that a few walls can drop my wifi speed from 68 Mbps to 0.5 Mbps over about 25 ft but that's what was happening *with* extenders (tried Apple and TP-Link.) I installed one of the Google Wifi routers and the bedroom speed was still terrible but after installing all 3 (yes instead of a 4500 sq ft home I needed 3 in an 1100 sq ft apartment) we now get speeds of around 40 Mbps sometimes better in the bedroom. So I am *very* satisfied and pleased that this works as I needed it to. The app is a nice feature too to know just how many devices are on our wifi system (can't hurt these days) and also to be able to pause devices when some of us need a break from electronics! Also happy I could turn off the lighting since one is sitting on our dresser and we didn't really need a night light.","positive"
"Easy setup.  Good speeds throughout the house.","Easy setup.  Good speeds throughout the house.We have a 1700 sq. ft. 1960's single story home.  Our internet comes into one corner of the house in the living room.  Bedrooms are on the opposite side of the house with plaster walls in between.  Our Apple Airport Extreme was good getting the wifi halfway but we lost the signal in the bedrooms and got nothing in the opposite corner of the house.  Using a Netgear extender with the Airport Extreme didn't help much.Installed the Google mesh and now we are covered.Main puck in the living room gets 110 Mbps download and 11 Mbps upload.  (no change from Apple router)Office gets 75-85 Mbps download and 11 Mbps up. (more reliable now no dropped wifi on our Nintendo Switch)Bedroom now gets 75 Mbps down and 11 Mbps up.  (where before we were getting next to nothing or dropped signals.)For a basic user I think this system works great.  I can assign IP addresses to my connected devices.  I can prioritize what device gets the bandwidth.  I can lower or turn off the LED on the pucks in the bedroom so it's not glowing.  I can see what device is currently using bandwidth and how much.I was hesitant at first about ordering this because of all the reviews that say the features are limited but if you just want to set up wifi that covers the house and you want some basic router features this system is perfect for 95% of the people out there.Will update this is anything changes.","positive"
"Powerful little puck","I recently upgraded my Xfinity service.  As part of that they included a modem with built in WiFi so I sold my Apple Airport.  The Airport worked well enough but I did need to get 2 WiFi extenders to cover the dead spots in the house.  The WiFi built in with Xfinity's modem is miserable.  I have many devices in the house and a few of them have an app that will let me know when they are disconnected.  This happened often.  Not only that but when the Wifi was connected the service was slow and spotty.  I know it was the WiFi since my wired devices worked well.I did some research and found that Google WiFi had good reviews.  I though about buying the 3 pack since I needed extenders with the Airport but figured I would give one a try and buy more if it worked well.The install was about as easy as it gets.  Download the app scan the QR code name the SSID and password.  Done.  I connected some devices and ran some speed tests. I have 200M service and was getting tests of up to 150M which is 2x my best test off of the old WiFi with the same service level.  Not only that I have great coverage throughout the whole house so no more extenders needed.  The house is 3000+ square feet 4 levels with the WiFi in the basement.  Could not be happier.  This is the best WiFI unit I've ever had (and I've had quite a few).","positive"
"Perfect for a hands-off wifi network","We live in a two-story L-shaped home that is just shy of 2700 square feet and is loaded to the gills with more devices than we really need (smart TVs Apple/Fire TVs game systems tablets phones laptops etc.). I'm not tech-stupid but I'm also no genius and networking has never been my wheelhouse. I've always had difficulty over the past three or four years with getting good strong signals to all corners of the house. We've had more nights than I can remember of settling in for a movie on the good TV only to suffer the wrath of the buffering wheel due to the distance and walls between it and the router.After fiddling with different combinations of modems routers repeaters etc. none of which really had any positive effect on our connectivity I threw in the towel: we were just going to have to deal with switching our phones to LTE in the bedroom or re-connecting to the wifi every time the office laptop was kicked off of it or finishing the popcorn before the movie actually starts. Then I saw something about this mesh network stuff.After poking around I found out about Google Wifi. Some more digging and I saw a lot of great reviews saying that it works wonders and is SIMPLE. Negative reviews said it's not advanced enough i.e. it's TOO SIMPLE. Perfect for someone like me that doesn't want to fuss over anything and just wants it to work.The devices are small clean and attractive; the accompanying app is informative intuitive and responsive; setup was as close to plug-and-play as I could get; maintenance is as yet not needed because I've had no issues.Each corner of each room has just as strong a signal as the corner of the room furthest from it. We're pulling speeds upstairs that we've never before seen. Our phones no longer stall out on wifi; my wife no longer gets kicked off her laptop; Netflix streams in 4k with ease. These were all small issues in the grand scheme of things but the tiniest annoyances become quite frustrating when they continue to pile up. Our home life is a little less frustrating now and we couldn't be any happier for it.One note: I also got a mount called The Spot by Mount Genie - it's pretty convenient as it allows each node to hang from the outlet into which it's plugged just by holding onto the plug itself.The Spot for Google WiFi by Mount Genie: The Simplest Wall Mount Holder Stand Bracket for Google WiFi routers and beacons.

"Google: finally bringing wireless routers into the 21st century","5 stars! Normally when I setup a new router I expect to waste an hour or two: downloading and installing the latest firmware configuring the firewall properly and troubleshooting the inevitable problems with one device or another not connecting properly.Google Wifi was up and running perfectly in 5-10 minutes. No joke. That includes the time it took me to pre-download the app to my phone a (Google Nexus 5x) take it out of the box and plug it in and the time it took for the Google Wifi router to download its own update and reboot itself.Seriously. This thing is almost everything I have ever wanted from a router. Easy controls from a phone app which works flawlessly so far. Great help functions -- for people who don't know much about networks and routers this would be *VERY* useful. The ability to remotely disconnect your kids devices at bedtime! Functions to speed test your network remotely anytime you want. And as an added benefit the router is small sleek and not an eyesore. (If it levitated and shot down mosquitoes with a laser it would get 6 stars.)One of the biggest benefits of going with a self-updating device backed by Google (a company that definitely knows something about internet security) is that I have a reasonable level of assurance that it will remain patched properly and up-to-date for at least the next several years. My old Asus router worked well enough but the latest firmware patches literally broke the device leaving me with the choice of a functional router with security holes or a paper weight with 'updated' firmware.Minor con: Only one 'outgoing' wired ethernet port. If you plan on wiring multiple other devices into your router find a good 'switch'. I am using the Linksys SE2800 8-Port Gigabit Ethernet Switch ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TLIVBG/ ) in conjunction with the Google Wifi router for the wired devices in my living room and everything works flawlessly.","positive"
"Knocked out my Netgear Nighthawk X6","This is my second set that i bought i bought one for myself from best but and i just order one on amazon for my daughter.I bought the Netgear Nighthawk X6 thinking it was going to fix my WiFi issues of not going to the back rooms of my co-op. I replaced two Apple AC Routers  with the netgear and it turned out that I had better reception and less interference with the apple routers. Almost every single day I had to reboot or changed the channel on the netgear and it drove me crazy  and their customer service support has no clue or gives you basic instructions that never helped I ended up buying two extenders which were a big mistake as I always had to reboot something.After reading up on the Google wifi I knew that this was what I needed I bought the three pack and it turned out that I needed to use all three. And I have to say. AMAZING a solid 215mbps throughout the house and I have not had to reboot it once I can walk to any room and still have the same signal and I love that.My house is full of HD streaming gaming junkies I use my apple TV at times and I use my fire TV as well I waited until everyone was home to test it outmy son was playing his on line game both my daughters were streaming Netflix streaming different movies one on a tablet and another on an iPhone 6 plus. My wife was streaming a movie from amazon in the kitchen  I was streaming a movie on apple TV in the living room and not one drop. Everyone was streaming without issues and that was beautiful.I really love the fact that I don't have to change channels as I live in NYC where there is so much interference and with the netgear I've always had to change the channels and with the Google not once it seems to do it on its own and it always picks the right channels.Another amazing thing is it has a strong solid ethernet connection what I mean about that is when I had ethernet connected with the X6 it was never stable it fluctuated anywhere from 156mbps to 50mbps with the Google it never drops past 156mbps which is amazing.Pros:no need for an extender which means full mbps because when you add an extender it drops mbps by half.It's beautiful not that the X6 wasn't beautiful in a spacecraft kind of way.I love the user interface it was so easy to set it up I'm so use to picking a channel or changing this or that with the net gear that it's a blessing to not have to touch it.I have tested this and love it everything connects automatically to the other mesh devices if I walk into the kitchen it changes from one mesh system to the next not like having an extender where you have to go into your phone or tablet and change from the router to the extender and vice versa.Cons:Can't pick which bond to connect your devices too I like to be able to connect streaming devices to the 5ghz and with this you never know if your device is connected to 5ghz or 2.4ghz.As much as I love the user interface app I wish they had it for the computer as well.With that said I've used many routers I've spent a lot of money on extenders and nothing ever worked like this unit I'm amazed and finally satisfied with my wifi.Now there are a lot of people who are leaving 1 star reviews on the speeds at no point does Google claim that this can handle speeds above 300mbps. That is why those who have 1gb of speed are seeing 300mbps those who have 1gb will need a router like the netgear X6 or x10 to handle such speeds there is nothing worse than people buying something without researching I guess those are the people who buy used cars without test driving them.If anything changes I will update but so far I'm in love...I have to say I spent exactly  $630 on the netgear X6 and the two extenders and only spent $300 on the Google and am beyond happy and satisfied with it.","positive"
"I can finally do all the things I want to do including making calls on my cell phone","At the time I am writing this there are over 2000 reviews of the Google Wifi system so let me just add a discussion of my specific circumstances in case it matches yours and can be of some help.My property has a gazebo in the rear yard (you might have a patio or detached garage) that is a really long distance from the wireless router in the office which is upstairs at the front of the house. The gazebo has a flat screen television  ROKU and Amazon Dot. Trying to stream Netflix or YouTube on the gazebo television was an exercise in frustration with constant buffering. Alexa was pretty much off line every time I tried to use it.Making matters worse my home has terrible cellular coverage so I rely on the Wi-Fi Calling setting on my iPhone to make and receive phone calls while at home. Even though I have a really good wireless router calls were really hit and miss unless we were close to the router.I installed three Google Wi-Fi pucks I’ll call them and the result was more than I had hoped for. The first is next to the computer in the office upstairs the second is basically beneath that one on the floor below and the third is as far back in the house as I could place it so that it would hopefully cover the gazebo.My direct cable connection in the office had always clocked in at a solid 100 Mbps with the downstairs computer at about 30 Mbps and the gazebo at 7 Mbps on a good day. The 30 Mbps wasn't terrible but it's frustrating to be limited to 30 (or ugh 7) when you are paying for 100 simply because you are having to use a wireless connection. With the Google pucks installed (installation was sooo easy) I now get 100 Mbps at EACH puck and the speed at the gazebo is over 30Mbps. What a joy to be able to use the outside television with lighting fast response and no buffering. Equally exciting I can now use my cell phone anywhere in the house or out in the gazebo.Here is the important point I want to pass along. Logic may not dictate the best placement of the pucks. It seemed logical to me that I would place the second puck in a line-of-sight position from the first in a position that looks down on the third puck by the back door. But even though the app reported that everything was fine and dandy when I tested the relative strengths of the pucks (easy to do with the app) number 2 reported only as “fair” and the downstairs computer was only hitting 30 Mbps. I then tried moving number 2 to the ground floor right next to the computer. That seemed counter-intuitive since number 1 now had to broadcast through a floor and there was now a wall between 2 and 3 but with that change the remote pucks both showed as “great” and the connection speed jumped to 100 Mbps.Bottom line: Don’t rely on your logic. Move the pucks around until you achieve the best possible coverage which may be in positions that seem illogical.Bonus tip: Although the speed to the puck at my ground floor computer was over 100 Mbps (tested with my iPhone touching adjacent to the puck) the speed being reported on the computer itself was less than 100 because even though it was just a foot away from the puck the wireless connection was slowing the speed. By simply connecting the computer to the puck with a network cable the speed increased by over 40 Mbps.Bonus tip 2: Your Amazon Dots and Echos can now be used as a whole-house audio system playing whatever music you select on whatever “groups” you choose to configure. My Dot in the gazebo is plugged into the TV's surround sound system and I wanted to be able to have the same music playing inside and outside through the Alexa devices. Previously I couldn’t get it to work because the connection to the outside Dot was just so poor that Alexa refused to make it part of a group. Since installing the Google pucks Alexa finally let my outside Dot join in the reindeer games. So nice to have the same music playing everywhere.Bonus tip 3: The app allows you adjust the brightness of the status lights on the pucks. I turned one of them up to the maximum setting in order to create a night light for that area.","positive"
"Best Router on the Market!","The Google Wifi router is simply amazing!  Not only is the design esthetically elegant the good folks at Google have also made the device intuitively and highly functional. Set up through the Google Wifi app was a breeze and in my case a complete god send since my 2017 MacBook Pro has an essentially nonfunctional ethernet connection despite having purchased a compatible ethernet to usb-c adapter.  I repeatedly received the dreaded “self induced IP address and will not connect to the internet” message and wasted hours speaking to various tech reps at Apple and my ISP.  It turns out that not being able to establish a connection to the internet with the use of ethernet is apparently a pervasive problem for all newer model macs for which Apple (and its associated forums) has no real solution.  This would thus prevent most folks who need a new traditional router from ever being able to install one.Luckily Google Wifi is one of the only devices out there that doesn’t require a hardwire/ethernet connection in order to set up!  After following the simple prompts through the Google Wifi app my set up was complete after just a few minutes. I immediately noticed that my internet was blazing fast which was confirmed when I completed a speed test.  I was getting over 70mbps on downloads despite paying for only 60mbps through Comcast which we all know provides notoriously awful service.  Google Wifi also easily recognized all of my devices (iphone iPad MacBook Samsung TV wireless printer) as soon as they were connected to my Wifi network.  The connection has remained extremely fast and consistent without any dead spots or dropped connections.  The coverage area has also been true to form as I only purchased a one pack router for my roughly 1200sq ft apartment.  However with the beauty of the Google Wifi mesh system those who have larger or multilevel homes will undoubtedly be able to set up full wireless coverage throughout their home with the use of multiple points.I enthusiastically recommend this product for anyone looking to replace a traditional router and has basic wireless needs.  The only people who seem to be dissatisfied with Google Wifi are techies who create complicated networks and require a high level of customization which this product does not offer.","positive"
"Great option simple to deploy fixes problems with reach","We live in a sprawling Florida 1-story home.  At right under 3K feet I decided to buy the 3 pack and set them up in strategic spots to create good coverage.  The Google Wifi system was easy to deploy and took the place of Linksys RE6250 which did not provide near the coverage we needed.Very impressed with the form factor which is a nice modern minimalist design and am impressed with the iOS application that I use to monitor the network.  Setting up the devices was as easy as plugging one of them into my cable modem downloading the application scanning the QR code on the bottom (or typing the code in manually) naming the network and then plugging each node into a power source and waiting for the network to discover them.  I was up and running in less than 10 minutes.Been running well for almost a week with no blips and great coverage that even goes out on the lanai.  My 85 year old Mom was having issues with inconsistent Wifi on her iPad while in her room at night.  Extremely frustrating for her when my efforts to use a wifi extender were just not enough.  I LOVE this Google product.  Reminds me of Google Glass in way - packing and deployment.  Follow the easy-to-understand and visual instructions and you should be up and running in no time.I had no issues with deployment and not a sneeze since.  I can log onto the application on my phone and see how the network is doing set up a guest network or do an family pause.  The speed of our network is super fast too ... I did not notice any degradation from these devices.5 stars.","positive"
"Stellar Router — but connected to mothership","# Pros## Pretty and Pretty PowerfulI got a single unit because my apartment isn’t that big but I’ve had problems with other types of routers; they seemed to have difficulty getting through the walls in my brick building. I also wanted something that didn’t look like a traditional router—they typically are eye-sores. The Google WiFi router fits the bill for both items.##ModularI also wanted something that could handle a bigger space if I moved. This seems like the perfect solution. In the past Wifi extenders have been complicated to use and rarely worked as advertised. Although I can’t attest to how his system performs it appears to be simple to set up with the phone app at any time.## SetupSet up was very easy if you get their phone app for iOS or Android.  I was done in 5 minutes.## Guest WiFiI really like that I can stipulate which IoT devices guests can interface with via the network. I’m sure other systems have this but were too complicated to set up for me to consider.## AppWell made app lets me change settings like passwords guest accounts and the LED light brightness. I also like that I may see what’s going on anywhere I am. There is a family setting that lets you cut off internet for members of your family.## Actual tech supportKnowing I can message or talk to someone if something goes wrong is a huge plus. Haven’t needed to call so I can’t comment on the quality of service.# Con (and subjective thoughts)## Privacy ParanoiaI feel ambivalent about linking the router with my Google account. This seems to require a Google account. So if you don’t have a Google account then that might add an extra layer of complexity and time. Also despite the app assuring me everything collected is done so anonymously I struggle to believe an ad business like Google which lives off of what it collects on its users can be completely trusted on this front. Paranoia—probably. I don’t intend to do anything illegal or embarrassing on my network so fine I guess. But total privacy and security is an illusion especially if you buy something like this from the king of data collection. So just realize what could go wrong even if Google vows to keep everything safe. I’m sure someone who actually read the terms in full could school me on this topic. In that case a brief summary would be appreciated. In any case I wish Google could explain to me more plainly what it intends to collect; otherwise I’m sure a lot of us will assume less than benign activity.","positive"
"Vastly improved my home Wifi network","I was looking for A/V specialists to run Ethernet cable through my house so I could hardware my router and bridge to extend the network.  At the time I was using the Apple AirPort Extreme and bridged an Apple AirPort Express.  My house is only about 1600 sq ft so this should have been fine but we were losing signal dramatically at the other end of the house.  Not sure if it was the materials of the walls but I had to use the cellular network when I was in my son’s room.  This led me to consider running an Ethernet cable from my router to the other end of the house.Then I looked into Google’s Wifi system and found that you can bridge more access points than Apple’s AirPorts.  Currently you can only extend Apple’s Wifi system once from the router.  Google can create a net to cover multiple directions and a greater distance.  Also Apple has not upgraded their Wifi systems in over 4 years.Now our Wifi reaches all corners of the house with close to 100mbps everywhere.  No more buffering when streaming from Plex or Netflix.  This system saved me the installation fee of hardwiring ethernet cables.  The set up was very quick and easy and the app is very clear and intuitive.  Google’s system also provides other services such as giving a device priority checking Wifi speeds and setting up guest and family Wifi.  I also like the idea of being able to extend the network even more if I wanted to although I probably will not need to.  This is probably a best bet for small businesses or larger homes with multiple levels.I would definitely recommend this system to everyone as I am very pleased with the results.","positive"
"It changed my life .. and how!","My before setup had a Belkin N600 dual radio in the den connected via 2 Ethernet powerline adapters to 2 other rooms driving a D-Link AC750 each. One AC 750 turned out to be flaky and had to be put to sleep. The other one chugged along at an acceptable speed. That remaining AC750 was the source for our Netflix connection. Seldom did a day pass without a breakage in connectivity and manual restoration (via quitting Netflix and resuming it after 30s or so) and we had gotten used to this mode of operation.My better half replaced my 4 year old Moto phone with another more modern Moto around Thanksgiving and I was getting used to it. Meanwhile the Netflix disruptions were getting too much to bear around the holiday season with snow/ice outside and not much else going on. I bit the bullet and splurged on a 3-device mesh.  Out went the Belkin and DLink routers and the pair of powerline Ethernet adapters and their wired mess. Ugh!Initial setup revealed some teething pains .. which surfaced when my 8 year old Vonage ATA died of old age probably upon finding that it had been connected to a modern router. Vonage rep wanted $79 for the ATA then $9 for S&H then waived everything. The smaller sleeker ATA arrived a couple days later and worked just fine.A second issue emerged and I suspected that one of the routers was iffy (e.g. it showed a red light a couple of times Goog WiFi reported that a device in the setup has a clashing IP address and overall in its vicinity connection to my new Moto would stall disconnect and then go quiet - no Internet!). Moving the router around a bit and restarting the mesh seemed to help initially a bit but devolved to the same old behavior. Some more troubleshooting ensued in which I suspected that the Moto was flaking out. Whaaaat? The 4 yo Moto could still connect to and hold the connection but the less than 2 mo Moto was dying right before my eyes! Moto customer service was involved and a session of troubleshooting confirmed my suspicion. Under warranty Motorola offered to replace my device. My inner voice shouted - run - this is your chance to live outside of the 2 GB RAM prison and run I did to Costco whose generous policy allowed me a refund a day short of 2 months from the date of purchase. I could have played with the phone for another month and Costco would still have taken it back.Mr Murphy famously said - the solution to a problem changes the problem - and my problem had now become finding a new phone. I did that and spent a mini fortune on a device I had vetted exhaustively (touch wood!).Our neighborhood was visited by the Gods of thunder and lightning recently and as a side effect my cable modem decided to hang up its boots too. Though I cannot ascribe it completely to the Goog WiFi :-) I had to change that too.Oh and then the laptop sitting next to a router dropped down to 2 Mbps speed - unbelievable - and in looking up solutions to the problem I discovered the magic of 'winsock reset' .. which sets the connection speed to >800 Mbps for at least a week. Phew!Story-telling apart  the mesh provides a solid connection with a single SSID and no Netflix drops. As you move around in the house your mobile device connects to the optimal router. From a smartphone you can check mesh status connectivity to the Internet and which devices connected to the network are consuming data. The last one is important - it tells me that my teenage kid is still up and active and I can either talk in person or set a rule to disallow access to certain devices routinely. The app is the cherry on the top very functional and easy to use. You can prioritize device access for instance your work computer or your TV streaming Netflix in order to get a better end-user experience. I can happily say that I do not miss my messy setup from the before life at all. Good riddance!If I had to change one thing - it would be the power cable design that feeds the pucks. It is hard to discern which side is which. Why couldn't Goog use Type-C connectors which are reversible?","positive"
"Great router with a functional sweet app","Works good they have a mobile app that helps you set it up. The experience within the app is super nice. I've had it for 3 months or so and it's working perfectly. I have 200mbps internet from Comcast I speed test often to ensure the quality of service I pay for and my wifi download speed is always around the 180 range. I'd say Google Wifi System is handling everything well.In the app you can easily:- check internet speed on Google Wifi (whenever you're trying to troubleshoot on network speed issue this comes in handy)- change password- set priority device(s)- set wifi schedule for certain users (ie kids)- set up guest wifi- home control features- get help or customer support- see if your cable is feeding wifi see what devices are connected to Google Wifi","positive"
"And consequently didn't suck. Which","I don't know how it works in your home but here at the Siegel household there are several devices/appliances that are a constant pain in the ass.My oldest daughter is 21 years old.I think we've been through 22 toaster ovens.Dustbusters have also been a bust. I don't know why but we have had a string of portable dirt sucking machines that never held a battery charge. And consequently didn't suck. Which ironically did.I also possess an infernal wireless network that was eternally disconnecting from the Interwebs leaving me with three woman and no access to Netflix Hulu or online Solitaire. That's an Estrogen Tornado you don't want to get close to.I can't tell you how many times I rebooted the router.Or updated the firmware.Or ran around the house plugging and unplugging Airport Extremes Airport Expresses and Apple Time Capsules hoping to sooth a flashing amber light and woo it back to the green.Nor can I calculate the amount of time spent on the phone with Apple Genii Chad Jeremy or Crystal reconfiguring the ethernet connections rearranging the WAN and LAN ports and reconfabulating the Java-scripted HTML-based hyper flick flacks.Last week I thought I had figured it all all when I relocated one of the network extenders to the crawl space under the house for a perfectly triangulated arrangement guaranteeing maximum coverage.The lights were green for THREE consecutive days. A record in my house. And then...Dad the internet went out. I was right in the middle of Game of Thrones!That was the digital straw that broke the router's back.To hell with you Apple I thought. And went and bought myself the new Google Wifi a new mesh type network that promises better dependability easier operation and a stronger connection throughout the entire household.Even to our detached garage where you will find boxes of discarded toaster ovens and dustbusters.I connected the first Google Wifi point to the modem and it lit up immediately. I unplugged the SIX Apple network extenders and replaced them with TWO new Google cylinders which are not only pleasing to the eye but incredibly efficient.There was a bit of trial and error but within 10 minutes I had the system up and running. And it's still running. With not one outtage.Moreover with a handy dandy iPhone app (oh the irony) I can monitor its performance and even redirect stronger coverage to certain devices.So the days of listening to my daughter's whine about the shitty connection in my house are over. Dear Google I would have easily paid twice the price for your incredible product.All of which makes an interesting point about consumer behavior.People aren't loyal to brands.They're loyal to brands who put out out better products.","positive"
"All the help you could ever need or want and then some","Don't waste your time....trying to fix any problems that might show up during installation.  Just call them toll free.  A native-English speaker will promptly answer the phone and spend whatever time you need for questions and information and perform in-depth research for your problem.  In fact it's hard to get them off the phone since they seem to need reassurance that they've helped you.  My problem: initial installation was simple and quick and most devices (computers phones TVs) immediately connected.  But my printers were different: one (non-wifi enabled) required Ethernet connection to the puck (the base station) whereas the other was WiFi.  Neither would connect.  The tech solved the problem when he researched and found that I needed to go into the printer -- not the computer (iMac) -- settings and have it search and identify the network.  Worked like a charm.  So feel free to read the instructions research the internet look at help sites etc.  But when you are ready just call them.  BTW: we now get great coverage of WiFi on our property/garage whereas a series of of WiFi routers range extenders etc had failed.","positive"
"Used two for one house and the last for another house!","I was going to buy this for my parents' house and also my house.  I bought the set of 3 to start for my parents' house.  They have a 2500 sqft 2 stories split level and the wifi is on the bottom floor.  The wifi router I had didn't seem to reach the upstairs very well.  I even bought a wifi extender - and still the same bad connection.  I set up this google wifi system. Tested the connection with just the 1 point but still didn't reach certain parts of upstairs.  Set up the 2nd point and the mesh system worked in all parts of the house!  So....I had the one left....took it to my house and replaced my old wifi.  My house is about 2400 sqft and I had to use a wifi extender that had worked well but started giving me problems.  It wouldn't automatically connect to the extender and kept connecting to the wifi router with spotty connection.  For some reason it took a few times to finally get the google wifi system up and running at my house....but it worked perfectly!  Didn't even need a 2nd one (since the one point is supposed to good for the size of the house).  I set up the google wifi app on my phone and can see the status of the devices in my house as well as my parents' house :)  It's pretty darn awesome.","positive"
"Very good WiFi coverage","Very good WiFi coverage. Super nice and sleek design. The setup took me less than 15 minutes. It just skyrocketed my WiFi speed. I Love that I can monitor all devices from my phone connected to my network test the network in a blink and move around without switch SSID. The set up in my house is 3 levels and I have strong WiFi everywhere. The only downside is the limitation on ethernet ports. Each mesh has one ethernet port available only so if you need to extend a wire connection to more than one device you might need an ethernet switch.","positive"
"Replaced my Airport Extreme.","This replaced my Apple Airport Extreme and I only wish I had done this sooner.  Setup is painless (it really is as easy as everyone mentions) and I had all three access points working in less than 10 minutes.  The coverage is much improved and so are the speeds. With the Airport Extreme I had a few areas in the house that had very weak signal.  I have over 20 wifi devices connected and have had zero issues.The google app for iphone is also well done and I like being able to see the network status and test the upload/download speeds.HIghly recommend.","positive"
"Wonderful Fast Solved our Wi-Fi issues","Very sleek and modern looking for leaving out in the open. More compact and higher powered than most other routers. We were having such trouble with our internet (snails pace) and turns out it was the older less optimal router we were using. Once we switched we saw soaring better coverage and our internet speed was back to where it should be. This router lets you see what devices are connected (good for security reasons) lets you allow visitors onto their own channel (again security-you never have to give out your wifi password again!) and you can prioritize which devices get the wifi the fastest. It fixed our problems is a wonderful and dependable Google product and is a great device for the money.","positive"
"Simply works.","Super simple to set up. I now have whole house coverage with 3 attractive little devices. Whereas before with 2 wireless routers I was unable to have full coverage.The first thing you notice about these (I have the 3 pack) is how well made and durable they appear. They don't have that cheap disposable feel. The packaging is superb and the included cables are seemingly high quality. I believe Apple started the trend of high end packaging and bringing an element of luxury to electronics. Maybe it's wasteful but it does add to the user unboxing experience.I spread my 3 devices out to include my backyard so I have 2 on the first floor of my 3 floor home and 1 on the second floor. In the basement I keep the wireless router that is supplied by my ISP. It only handles one device wirelessly now which is the house printer. Everything else that is wireless is now on the Google mesh system.With all the devices spaced out to where I think it will cover everything I begin the setup process. One device has to be hardwired with an Ethernet cable directly from your router. Done. All need to be powered up. Done. Install the Google Wi-Fi app on your phone and follow the VERY easy to use instructions that will walk you through the process step by step. It literraly takes a handful of minutes to get your house blanketed by high speed internet.A feature I especially like is the guest Wi-Fi. I can set an easy to remember password and toggle this feature on whenever I throw a party or have guests at the house. Toggle it off when it's not needed. I can also can check the status of the mesh remotely. Can reboot or update each one individually. Run diagnostics and speed tests. It's pretty great. Best part is there hasn't been a single hiccup since I installed it. Not one minute of downtime.I highly recommend this product if you have a home where Wi-Fi isn't getting to all areas.","positive"
"Completely solved my poor wifi signals in house in an attractive design and super-easy app setup.","After much frustration with my Verizon FiOS wifi router coverage including trying one of their $6/mo extenders and still have dead zones in my house I decided to try Google wifi after reading many positive reviews.  Well the reviews were right!  What a great product...I meshed all three routers and now have a very strong signal throughout my house.  Pros:  attractive design super easy setup excellent signal excellent smartphone interface to control name test and monitor your home wifi network.  Cons:  None yet.  I'm very very pleased with this product and it has solved my wifi signal issues.  One item of note:  I have FiOS for both internet and TV so you have to connect one of the Google wifi units to the Verizon router with an ethernet cable which Google included in the box then disable wifi on your Verizon router which is easy with the Verizon FiOS app; so your FiOS signal still comes first to your Verizon router and is then passed on via a cable to the Google router.  Quite easy.","positive"
"It Just Works","I am an IT professional and this product has improved my quality of after-work life more than any other. Let me explain.For several years I had an in-home network with three linksys routers only one of which was configured as a router and the other two as wireless access points. I set up and administered the network myself. I can’t tell you how many times I heard from my kids “Dad the Internet is slow” or from my wife “honey can you fix the internet?” Uggg - wrestling with IT was the last thing I felt like doing after a long day’s work. After countless firmware upgrades and researched tweaks to the configuration the fix seldom lasted more than a few days.I have since ripped out the Linksys routers and replaced it with the google WiFi system (keeping my cable modem). Since that time everything just works! Not a single problem. If you were to ask my family I single handedly fixed the internet ; ). Thank you Google!","positive"
"Google WiFi System","01-20-18: It seems that almost every two years I need to replace my router. My last router was an Asus and it performed pretty good and still works. I was looking to replace my router with something that could increase my wifi range. I tried several routers. The first was a Netgear Nighthawk AC3200. It worked for about a day and then it started rebooting itself dropping all my clients. Not acceptable. That was returned. The next one I tried was a TP Link AC3200. It also worked for about a day and started dropping clients and not working reliably. I couldn't even stream from one device without buffering. Not acceptable. I was starting to think it was something else interfering. When I installed each router I made sure that it didn't interfere with any other wifi signals around me. I tested to see what channel to broadcast on and configured it to that channel. Still dropping clients. Getting fed up I decided to try this Google WiFi system. Installation was a breeze through the Google WiFi app. I configured my wireless and then began the task of installing all my cameras. This requires port forwarding. I installed each camera with no problem. I wasn't able to access them remotely though so port forwarding was not working correctly. My cameras are UPnP compliant so I enabled this through the app. I found that this was the problem. I disabled UPnP and I was then able to access remotely. So far so good. I will update in about a month. Hopefully this will have solved my wifi problems.UPDATE 03-23-18: It has been about two months and everything is working flawlessly. I am very happy with this system. I would definitely recommend these. Hopefully Google will continue to add features to the app to make this even better.UPDATE 05-07-18: System still working flawlessly. Have not had any issues with connections or speed. I have six IP cameras hooked up to my system and they work great. I can access them with no problem remotely.","positive"
"Easy set up and spectacular performance and cool features.","So most of you who are looking at this have WiFi issues at home. Coverage isn't great in some spots or no coverage at all. Look no further. After doing an extensive amount of research this solution appeared to be the best. I have to say that for sure this is a great solution. First let's start with how they look. Relatively smalland a nice round shape with a white color the units blend right in. There is a glowing light ring in the center which I found a bit annoying in my bedroom but quickly discovered you can adjust the brightness or even turn it off completely. SCORE! I purchased wall mounts for them (Myriann Wall Mount Holder Wall Mount Stand Ceiling Bracket (3 Pack)For Google Wifi) so they are up on the wall and hardly noticeable. Next is setup. This could not be easier. While I am a bit techy you really don't need to be. You connect to your existing WiFi router (mine is FiOS) download the Google WiFi app and just follow the instructions. I have 3 units. The main one is in my office in a downstairs area not near much (probably why my WiFi suffered in the first place). Then you basically just plug the other units in scan the barcode on the bottom and the app does the rest. I turned off the FiOS WiFi so there wouldn't be any issues switching between the Google WiFi and FiOS. I have a 2200 sq ft home and have 3 units. Lastly is performance. WOW. Just WOW. Every inch of my home is covered as well as a decent distance around the outside. The mesh network doesn't drop the speed is consistent and I'm getting close to the 1Gb I pay for (have tested around 900Mb). In addition to the absolutely amazing and simple set up and performance there are some features on the app that some of you may love. One being - you can identify your kids devices or any device that connects to the WiFi network and you can pause their connection. Yup = if you go to sleep you can shut down your kids WiFi access. Any or even all devices. Eating dinner? Shut 'em down! Also for you with young kids you can restrict known adult sites as well. If your kids are streaming video and you want to prioritize your device you can do that too. Some really cool features. I am so happy I made this purchase and highly recommend it for ease of use performance and some cool features. Control it all from your mobile device too. Just a great job Google!","positive"
"Why did I wait so long to take the plunge?","Like many others that have commented on this item I have tried numerous extenders in an effort to expand and increase the wifi coverage in my home. I never have had much luck with any of them and was somewhat hesitant to make such a pricey purchase for this system. I bit the bullet after reading through numerous reviews both here and on other online sites. I cannot even express how happy I am that I made this purchase. It seems like a steep price but it worth every penny. I have probably spent this much on all the other worthless extenders I've tried over the years. I do work in the IT industry but it is not necessary when it comes to the simple setup Google has for this system. It literally took me 10 minutes from start to finish...I did it on my lunch break. I literally took the first Google access point out of the box and plugged it into the modem and power source and poof it connected to the app without any issues at all. Then the other two access points were easy...the app walks you through the setup and in a matter of minutes you have a mesh network setup and ready to go. The best part of all is to see the network speeds you get after setting up this system. I even get over 100 mbps in my backyard now! I don't regret this purchase and I bet you won't either. Take it from someone who debated the purchase as well...you won't forgive yourself if you don't go for it!","positive"
"Works Great for Long Shaped Apartment","[ Issues ]- Similar to a few of the reviews mentioned I live in a NYC apartment that is not very big but has a pretty long distance from living room to bedroom (about 75 feet). The kitchen and bathroom are located the middle between the living room and bedroom building is pre-war with high ceiling and thick walls. I’ve always struggled with spotty and weak signal at the furthest room which is the bedroom.- Streaming video or using sonos are impossible I’d be lucky if I could browse online without the internet disconnecting on my phone or desktop- I use Plex media server located in my bedroom. I just want to watch my stuff on the TV in the living room without buffering every other min.- Multiple router set up is too complicated for me (maybe in the next life)[Solutions that did not work]- Long range routers- WiFi extenders- Physically wire ethernet cable but wiring is messy and visually unpleasant. Had issues setting up the configuration for Plex.[Solution that works finally!]- Google WiFi is simple to set up the 3 pack took total of 15 mins to set up. The most time spent was on deciding where to place the pods.- I have 100Mbps speed internet with Spectrum Google WiFi speed test ranges from 65Mbps ~ 102Mbps.- I’m able to use Plex on tv in my living room and have media server in the bedroom no extra configuration needed.- Video streaming in 4K works fine without buffering.- It’s been 8 months since my purchase I only had issue once and it was because of Spectrum service outage for a day.- Sonos works flawlessly through the apartment. Phones and Laptops work fine as well.- Love how you can control light level on each device. I usually turn the bedroom pod off so it’s not distracting when I go to sleep.- Easy to change guest WiFi log in info on your phone.","positive"
"Easy set up ! Great coverage! Internet working much faster now!","Loved the set up. I am not a computer wiz. Has two cords coming out of the back ....one plugged into a wall socket and the other into the internet modem. ( yes you need to have internet acces in your home / modem ...to plug into) .From there you just listen to Google and follow on screen directions and it’s pretty easy to set up. Not like my old router where you needed to be computer knowledgeable to set up all sorts of ip addresses and pretty much be a computer tech.  Only needed one unit for my house which is under 1500 square feet If I don’t include my basement level. Works throughout whole house. Thought my computer was slow and crawling at times because of my internet provider but it was my old router that was not doing it’s job because it was about four years old and technology has changed so much...my router was outdated and slow. Streaming movies had my T.V. screen telling me I didn’t have enough bandwidth which I didn’t know was because my router was not able to do the job.  Something I didn’t know ...even if your paying for internet provider at turbo speed ...if your router is old it is not able to send that turbo speed to your devices.....because it is old.","positive"
"Works great.  Not cheap","I love it.  I came from a TP link AC router that I had to reboot about once a week for one reason or another.  Ive been doing IT for a long time so I figured it would be easy to setup but it literally took about 5 minutes.  The coverage is great and I'm only using 2 of them in a 1700 square foot house.  I have only had to reboot them once in the 6 months or so since I got it.  I really like the app.  It's easy and intuitive to do simple stuff you can easily look at realtime individual device bandwidth utilization QOS devices disable internet to specific devices moat of the more advanced features you'd expect are there (DNS  server setting static IPs Nat upnp port forwarding) and you can manage the network remotely with the app.  It's pretty darn cool.  I was talking to a co-worker who uses a paid VPN about it and he had me check if there's a proxy config to point it at the VPN.  I don't think this is possible.  I wish there was a web interface.  If you hit the IP of any of the access points it just tells you to go download the app on your phone.","positive"
"Easy setup and great WIFI!!","So far this has been amazing.  I already have the Google ON-hub and connected to Google WIFI was a breeze. With more use of my network with smart lights and outlets my WIFI has been struggling with dead spots. Setup of the mesh network is all done in Google WIFI app. The app did all the work. All that is needed from you is select add a WIFI point and what room you are placing it. Take a picture of the QR code on the back and done. I am now getting the speeds I am paying for. The app is very useful after setup you control your network with a guest sign in so friends and family only access what you want them to. You also can prioritize a device on your network. Say you are streaming Netflix you can select that device to prioritize your traffic. With that you can also block devices for parental control. All updates are automatic done. I am a network student and this product is amazing. Very easy and simple and easy to use with great networks speeds. Mesh networks are becoming popular recently. I have only used Google's. I would recommend to do research and choose what your needs are. From what I am seeing mesh networks are great option for people looking to solve WIFI problems at home.","positive"
"WiFi speed jumped 5x instantly. 50Mbps to 250Mbps. Like ethernet over wifi.","I didn't find the set-up as frustration free as advertised. I had several issues trying to get the main pod to connect with the others. After several frustrating attempts I called Google. My call was answered after 1 ring by someone in the US who was knowledgeable diagnosed and fixed the issue within moments Amazing!!!!After resetting the problem unit (disconnect power hold reset button and power-up. Then release button and wait about 5 minutes for it to reset.) I had the system up and running. After it automatically ran the software update I wanted to see if Google WiFi was worth the money. It is no question.Prior to the Google WiFi I had a Linksys AC1750 dual band that was about 3 years old. I was able to achieve around 50/60 Mbps if I was right next to the router and on 5Ghz. With the Google WiFi I consistently get between 180 and 250 Mbps. Blazing fast for Xfinity. Also since it broadcasts one network on both 2.5 and 5Ghz I no longer have to manually switch networks or run slower printers and computers on the 2.5Ghz network. You'll only have one network and can let the router decide who goes where.I also have ethernet cables run into each room so I hooked up ethernet backhaul for the two remote units. It really didn't make much of a difference. About 10Mbps extra on average. Not worth considering if you don't have cables run throughout the space because the Mesh is amazingly fast without it.Without a doubt the Google WiFi  has made a world of difference in my enjoyment of surfing and my Roku is now screaming fast. Shows come up instantly and never buffer. Add in great customer support and it's a winner","positive"
"Fantastic!","Got this router because my airport express was not giving me even half of the speed I pay for with many lags while trying to stream videos. I have 155Mbps RCN service and had tested it many times in the 60Mbps range sometimes in the 50 and 40 range on my laptop through the airport. Testing right from the modem on my laptop would get 160 170 Mbps so I was thinking what in the world is wrong? Do I happen to keep testing it at exactly the right time for everything to seem normal? Even at 40Mbps you shouldn't have any troubles streaming but I was. So I thought I will try a new router and after much deliberation decided on the Google wifi router which arrived today. The setup was pretty simple and the app walks you through it. It also walked me through cycling the power of the modem and the router as well because I encountered a connection issue which it said was normal. And guess what... I tested the speed a few times right away and after a few hours now and all times the speeds have been in the upper 180Mbps (187189187186). That's better than I'm supposed to get so I am incredibly happy. I have no need for advanced settings and my apartment is about 750 square feet so one point is perfect. I hope it stays this way but currently this is the best purchase I made this year. Thanks Google and Amazon!","positive"
"Solved my problems","The system isn't cheap but it's worth it. My wifi speeds close to the main unit are almost as fast as my wired speeds.  Most impressive though is this Speedtest that I ran at the far end of my home where I had previously received such a weak signal that my phone switched to my data plan.  This took minutes to set up and exceeded my expectations with regards to speed.","positive"
"Very impressive easy to install and use","I'm not a network expert but I probably have an above average understanding of computers.  This was my first mesh network install of its kind.  I used to have the crappy router that came with the cable service.  Then I tried the Apple Airport Extreme.  Recently I purchased this system.The problem with Apple is that they are clearly no longer interested in being in the WiFi business.  Their app is lame as usual they'd rather present the illusion of simple when in reality the cost of that is functionality.  Speaking of cost as an Apple product it is outdated and overpriced.  And I say all this as an Apple fan with two MacBook Airs a MacBook Pro two new touch bar MacBook Pros an iPad an iPad Pro an Apple Watch and four Apple TVs in the house.So I just replaced my old Apple network which had a full sized base station and a repeater with a three piece mesh system by Google.My biggest gripe with the system is that there is only one physical ethernet port on the device.  Previously I had my primary Apple TV PS4 and smart TV all hardwired for better streaming and access.  And I had a Philips Hue hub attached to both the base unit and the upstairs repeater.  With the Google system I had to drop down to having only one connection which had to be the Hue.I was concerned about lagging on the PS4 for gaming and streaming speeds.  However I was pleasantly surprised.  I can stream in 4K without issue.  I can play Call of Duty at Master Prestige level without any noticeable change in gaming experience.  I have four Nest security cameras around the outside of my home and they now stream far more reliability the network coverage being stronger they don't drop off the network from time to time like they used to.When streaming Spotify at max bit rate my Bose SoundTouch 30 did pause once but there is a very good chance that was either my ISP or Spotify itself.  Because I have had no other network issues with 30 devices on the network.I like the mesh concept.  I think the units are attractive.  I think Google has created an amazing app that is informative and very powerful allowing users to put priority on certain devices and even kick junior off the network if he or she should be doing something else!I've never seen a network with such control so intuitive so robust and capable of powering a tech heavy home.But the bottom line here is the bottom line.  There are many systems one could get but at the time of buying this product was well under $299 with free same day delivery.  Most other multi piece mesh systems cost far more money.  I didn't feel like I was being cheap here though.  This system had a very premium feel to it like I was buying high end yet saving quite a bit too.So far so good we'll have to see how it goes long term.","positive"
"Solved my wall penetration issue and provides seamless 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz connectivity!","I have ASUS  Dual-band Wireless-AC1900 Gigabit Router Black ( RT-AC68U) in my home which has served me well enough for the most part. The issue I have with it (besides the firmware updates potentially giving it connectivity issues by dropping your devices constantly but is now fixed) is that the antennas do a great job of high data rate with line of sight (when in view of the router) but like most Wi-Fi routers falls short of wall penetration and therefore you have weak signal in another room just 30 feet away. I do video calls with my wife all the time but when she walks away from the living room where the router is and goes upstairs the call gets dropped a lot. There might be better Wi-Fi systems but this really solved my connectivity issues throughout my home! It took me about 20 minutes to set all three of the modules up and spaced out enough to cover my 1150 square feet 2-story townhome. The app was very easy to use to allow it to self-connect with the other modules; able to connect my Ethernet-only devices to the outlaying modules like my smart TV that does not have built-in Wi-Fi; you're able to power the Google devices with a  USB type C which can help extend the power cable so you're not restricted to power cable length and my personnel devices were able to connect and switch to either 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz seamlessly without having to manually pick one or the other at any given time! The ease of use cost and name brand sold me regardless of the other potentially better ones.","positive"
"Connection reliability is VASTLY improved with this thing","I've suffered with slow and unreliable connectivity for a long time with multiple disconnects on pretty much a daily basis.  My VOIP phone (Ooma) had become practically useless as had my Roku and Fire TV boxes.  I blamed my ISP (always the easiest thing to do) but decided to swap out my highly-reviewed router with this Google thing to see how many of my problems (if any) were caused my old router.They were ALL caused my old router.  Or if not caused they were cured by this Google device.  I've had no connectivity issues at all - none! - since the absolutely painless installation of this thing.  I did have to add a TP-Link network switch (ASIN=B00A128S24) so I could plug in a few items and I was worried that the magic would die as soon as I threw that into the mix.  Nope.  No issues at all.  The switch is literally plug and play.  I ran a cable from the Google WiFi output to port 1 of the switch then connected my other items to other ports on the switch and that is all.This single Google Wifi is effortlessly supporting a desktop PC (hardwired thru the switch) several devices connected thru powerline adapters (Roku FireTV laptops) and several wireless devices (tablets phone printer smart doorbell Amazon Echo).  It's inside a closed cabinet at one end of my one-story 1300sf house.  Wireless devices at the extreme opposite end of the house have perfect connectivity.  I routinely connect to my workplace's computing environment thru a VPN and that has been chronically unreliable but no more.  Video streaming was similarly frustrating before but it's a joy now.I've begun to think of Google as leaning more and more toward the Dark Side and kinda wish I didn't like this product so much but wow...what a fine piece of work this is!","positive"
"Don't waste your time waiting for Google Wifi Support","Started with intermittent loss of internet and ended with a total failure of all three routers. Spent close to 2 hours with Google Wifi support last Sunday without resolving the issue.  That was a week ago today with the assurance provided that it would be expedited. The only response I received was from the tech 3 days later 2 days after requesting the status... Suddenly Google is too busy resolving the issues others are having...Really?If you are having any problems with Google's Wifi Mesh Routers I recommend returning  and getting  your money back. Not ready for Prime TimeUpdate: Over a week later second response to my second status request: Thank you for contacting Google Wifi Care. I have check on your case and it is currently being worked on.I will reach out to you when I hear anything back as a result.Thanks again for reaching out to us. If you have any questions regarding Google Wifi in the future please feel free to keep this email so you can simply reach out to me.Even if you're uncertain of whether we can assist you or not I can at the very least guide you to where you need to go.ThanksWifi CareSame response provided twice.According to the tech Dustin who I chatted with online while providing this update their people are very busy resolving issues and it will be some time before they have time to resolve my issue.Purchase at your own risk!","positive"
"Huge Improvement Over Old Router and Extender.  Good phone/table based app to setup and monitor.","Replacing my old Cisco Linksys E2500 and a wifi extender which was due for the bin I now have much better wifi coverage in my 2 story 2250SF house and out on my patio.  The install was pretty straight forward and the system updates itself. Hopefully this will be trouble free for the next few years.  Considering how much wifi crap I now have at the house the improvement in bandwidth and coverage is quite pleasing.  The only caveat is that I needed to spend an extra $14 to buy a 4 port gigabit switch to plug into the primary unit as it only has one usable ethernet port the other one being used to connect to my cable modem. Having just one wifi network with 2 additional access points meshed is a step up from having a wifi network from my old router and a separate one for the extender.","positive"
"Holy BLEEP This Thing is Great!","I don't LIKE to give 5-star review but the difference is astounding. Attached is a before (Spectrum FiOS using the 5g WiFi) and after (using the Google WiFi. The computer is (I measured) 19 feet from the FiOS WiFi router the distance was not the issue. Setup was stupid-easy even for me. Adding the additional mesh points was as well but (oddly) took about six minutes each time to update to latest software during which the network as a whole dropped for a bit. The on-phone software is simple straightforward and easy to understand and interact with. I'd love to give you Pros and Cons but I don't have any Cons yet. If anything less that WOW comes up I'll update the review.","positive"
"Pretty stinking awesome.","Google WiFi has been a god send. We have a nearly 4000 square foot house and recently switched internet providers to get much better speeds. Only downfall is the provided router had poor coverage. SoI bought the Google WiFi pack (3pcs). Now I ave coverage all throughout the house and even out in the yard. No loss of speed at all anywhere. Love it.Only one issue. One printer hooked right up on the network without any trouble. but we have one printer that refuses to connect to it. Not sure why and can’t figure it out. the one we have trouble connecting with the network is a lower end printer so it’s not that big of a deal. We ended up just connecting it directly to the ISP network and skipping the Google WiFi network. Not ideal but it works.I also know that Google is most likely tracking everything we do online because of using their mesh network. However I have smart TVs smart phones Amazon accounts... etc. It’s not like I’m not already being tracked so the thought of Google tracking me a little more isn’t something that deters me form using this. Sure I wish nobody was tracking me but if you’re reading this review you’re being tracked. So... whatcha gonna do.Anyway... setup was super easy. Speeds are great. Coverage in the house is amazing. I would definitely buy again and would recommend to anyone needing better WiFi coverage in the house.","positive"
"Wow just wow","We have a pool house where I like to work. For the life of me I could not get a wi-fi signal out there. The signal had to travel through two brick buildings so in order for me to use my laptop out there I had to create a personal hotspot using the data on my cellphone.I looked into getting someone to come out an install internet wires in the pool house but the mesh system was much cheaper. I figured I would return it if it did not work.The system was SUPER easy to install. I was worried because during testing it looked like the signal was weak. I am running several objects on the wi-fi in my backyard (smart TV with netflix running laptop 2 cellphones) and it is super quick (even with the weak signal back here). I can now install a wi-fi thermostat and smoke alarm in the pool house. I am more than overjoyed.","positive"
"It just simply works","I've had pretty much every type of Wi-Fi modem just switched from a 9 unit open mesh Network which had been working great for a couple of years but stopped playing well with my devices Google Wi-Fi is a fantastic solution for the modern-day home keeps all my smart devices online all the time I have six I highly recommend plugging in as many as you can one of them is plugged into the modem and then a tp-link switch is plugged into that and from there wires go all through the walls and attic into every room that connects to each Google Wi-Fi unit and then from each unit goes into a switch in that room to plug into the wire devices like gaming systems or stream boxes.  It's easy it works great I heard it doesn't work with fiber apparently you can only get 300 megabytes per second out of it which is what I'm paying for so I'm happy with it and wired I get 350 through it so not sure why some people are getting capped at 300 I hope Google updates it too work with faster speeds so that when I get fiber ..... If it ever comes to my area I can keep the system","positive"
"If you have multiple floors...","My house (about 1900 sq ft) has three levels - main floor upstairs and basement so I went with the 3-pack.My modem is located on main floor in the back of the house in the family room  so that is where my main Google WiFi device was placed (and connected to my modem)The second one was placed at the top of the landing upstairs. The stairs are located midpoint between the front and rear of the house.  The third one was placed in the basement near a wall not far from the bottom of the stairs.As everyone else has already mentioned set up was a breeze.THE SIGNAL IS STRONG THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HOUSE!  Multiple devices (cell phones; laptops; wireless security cameras; Netflix streaming on TV's via Roku and Amazon stick).  (EDIT since I wrote the original review:  I have a Roku in a bedroom on the first floor.  Even though the bedroom is on the first floor  it picks up the signal from the pod that is in the basement  and I wasn't completely happy with the response on the Roku box  so I ran an Ethernet cable from the first floor pod to the Roku in the bedroom and it now works great with the stronger signal)All I can say is that the Google WiFi network setup works great.(My previous setup was three hard-wired routers located in similar locations.  Signal strength from routers was nowhere near as good as Google WiFi)Kudos Google!","positive"
"The Future of WiFi","These are AMAZING! You might think you have your router all set-up and awesome but the reality is these are FAR better (unless you're a network professional). The distributed mesh network gives ample coverage in my 2 bedroom apartment and I can even get signal in the parking lot across the street from my complex! The setup was easy to follow and the reassurances the app gives you while going through the steps was actually rather humorous at times. It only took me about 15 minutes to get them up and running the lights on them are completely adjustable (either brighter or dimmer/off) which was great since we have one in our bedroom and didn't want a night-light keeping us up. My network speed tests went from 25 Mbps to 65 Mbps. And the 2 additional Ethernet ports meant I could directly connect my desktop computer to the mesh network without needing a WiFi dongle/card. It works great and I have no complaints. Now I am upgrading my cable modem to get even more out of my internet speeds since this one provides more than enough bandwidth to watch movies stream Steam games from upstairs to the TV downstairs and have numerous small devices connected at the same time. No issues with Mac/Android or buffering problems with YouTube/Facebook. Everything just works right out of the box plus it maintains itself. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this router setup it's truly the future of WiFi!","positive"
"Easy to set-up and use great coverage area great app","I have had the 3 google pucks for over 3 months now. I must say that I absolutely love the mesh setup.The set-up:  It was very easy and straight forward with the app. It walks you through every step.The coverage area:  I have 2400 Sq Ft single floor home and the 3 pucks provide coverage in every nook and cranny of my home. I love the fact that the mesh network provides seamless coverage so you don't disconnect from one area and then have to connect to another area of the home (like WiFI repeaters or Access Points).The App:  It is very easy to use and navigate. You can literally check the status of everything about the network on the app. You can see how many users are on their usage of the network etc. You can even set bandwidth priorities for certain devices. It shows you your password(s) if you can remember them. It also lets you set up a guest network with more restricted access.Placement:  I would highly recommend getting a Google WiFi Outlet Holder Mount. The mounts I got are the ones where you wrap the cord on the back side of the holder it hold the puck right by the outlet. They work perfectly. the pucks are not in the way and there are no cords hanging around anywhere.Overall I couldn't be happier. I would recommend this to anyone that needs wider network coverage area in their home.","positive"
"Great coverage so far!","So far it's great. My house is only 1700 square feet single storey but I have over 50 devices on the network 10 of which are cameras (a hobby not paranoia) and we also want enough bandwidth to a detached garage on the other side of the patio to watch 1080p security cameras with sound. I had an Archer router and two extenders which worked fine in the house but wifi in the garage was poor and extenders are a different network which made sharing a printer with my husband's Man Cave a pain. I set up one GW point high on the wall perpendicular to and closest to the garage another in the living room and the third in the hallway outside the Man Cave effectively bypassing the furnace room and washer/dryer wiring that had always made that room wifi-unfriendly. Everything works very well indoors and the garage is good so far; we'll wait and see for that because it's really a lot to ask of wifi. If the garage signal still isn't strong enough I'll get another GW point and hardwire it. GW is quite expensive sure but not having to switch connections to get the best reception depending upon whether I'm inside in the garage or somewhere in the yard makes me happy. Setup was very simple and had I just used DHCP for everything I'd have had it all sorted in an hour but the cameras and my ZoneMinder server need static IPs and I have a bunch of TCP and RTSP ports that have to be forwarded so it's taken a lot longer. Speed is excellent and while I do not particularly like our ISP our connection is pretty fast and stable so I don't anticipate problems. I *really* wish GW had a web interface though because it's a pain to type with one finger on a phone or tablet when I could be touch-typing with both hands on a keyboard.","positive"
"For cost per unit this was perfect and frustration free!","Super simple set up as long as you have a smartphone. Seriously this was the easiest thing to install I think I've ever used for networking a house. Initially it told me the main unit wasn't getting an IP address (had just unplugged the previous old router so probably just needed a cable modem power cycle). Sure enough right as I was about to do that the dialog walking you through that process popped up and 60 seconds later the main unit was online and ready to add the other mesh points.Adding the other points was a breeze choose location plug in and scan code. Done whole 3500SQF set up with wifi in about 15 minutes.Features enough networking customization for most everyday use (port forwarding etc) but folks that like to really tweak settings like QOS might find it a bit limited - I didn't find it a major issue as it handles traffic well. QOS is basically automatic aside from being able to set priority devices in increments of 1-4 hours slightly annoyed that there isn't a permanent priority (there's a permanent pause for devices so maybe this can be worked in later).All in all for a balance of ease of use easy of setup and frustration free utilization month after month this is a joy.  In months of use I have yet to have a single device or node drop offline (the cable modem dropped once but completely isolated issue from the Google WiFi units - heck the units were the things that let me know something was wrong with the LED ring on them).Completely happy with product no more screwing around with multiple SSIDs repeaters or other access point foolishness.","positive"
"4x Faster Downloads and Opened up Bandwidth","I am throwing away my old Netgear router after purchasing this. I’m not sure why but over the last year it got slower and slower. Over the last two years we’ve acquired more connected devices like Kindles for the kids and smart TVs. However these aren’t always on. Regardless the internet speeds were getting slower and if we had both adult phones a smart Tv and our main PC connected to the web we’d bog down our internet connection and run out of bandwidth.No more! Once connecting this I ran a speedtest and got about 83 MBps compared to no more than 20 before. My ISP claims they are giving us “up to” 100 MBps so now I’m getting more of my money’s worth. Uploads are increased slightly form 3-4 to about 5 MBps.  And most importantly my bandwidth bottleneck is completely eliminated. We can have as many devices on WiFi as we want - it barely affects speeds.Great product.","positive"
"Your home network is only as strong as your router. I highly recommend Google WiFi for anyone who is tired wifi headaches","I simply love the Google Wifi!I'm a long time Android user and have managed various routers over the years everything from Linksys to Belkin to Acer units. The one thing they all had in common was the one thing all routers have had in common up until now - problems.My latest router (Linksys WRT1900AC) was actually a solid performing unit - but like so many others... required periodic troubleshooting and a reboot at least once every few weeks. The worst offense however was that my Google Pixel phone would hang at times so much so that I began skipping even turning on my phone's Wifi at home due to the inconvenience.That became a problem even more so when leveraging things like video chat WiFi Calling and the uploading photos / videos to social media. Finally I reached a point a few weeks ago that I just couldn't ignore it anymore.The Google WiFi is everything I didn't know I needed. It looks better than most things sitting on my computer desk (and in my home really) and the WiFi signal even without external antennas goes farther than my previous Linksys router ever did in my three story house.After a quick setup via mobile app I was off and running and have been for a few weeks now with ZERO issues on the Google WiFi. It is so refreshing knowing that all my devices work flawlessly on the network and I'm noticing other benefits like my IP camera having more consistent functionality and better image quality.I really am so pleased with this router. Well worth the $100 I paid for a single puck.","positive"
"Fantastic - easy to use - easy to setup - really works!","In a word: fantasic!We have Frontier/Verizon Fios and our house is 3200sf. Even with wifi extenders there's always been a bit of a problem in the far reaches of the house. As you know Frontier is of little help (for this or ANY issue). After researching about these wifi mesh options and comparing lots of options we narrowed it down to Google Wifi and Orbi. Since I have a long history of using Google products and we've always been satisfied with them and since the price for Google was lower as well we went the Google route.The setup could not have been easier! It was essentially plug and play.The results were instant - great coverage everywhere. We're have 100/100 speeds and we're consistently around 95/95 anywhere in the house.Streaming is now fast and instant - no more buffering!The additional features of the system via the G-Wifi App for your phone are really EASY to use and offer great options: prioritizing a device using family mode to control kid's devices having a separate code for guests running a network check etc. You can even control other devices on the Google Home network if you add those as well (for example the Nest Therm etc).BOTTOM LINE: it's a great price for getting wireless coverage for your entire house.","positive"
"Amazing wifi system","I finally got around to hooking this up and it's amazing.  I can't imagine anything being simpler to hook up.  For the first router which you plug into your modem you simply scan the QR code on the bottom of the unit and then the app does the rest for you.  When you go to install another unit in another room as soon as you plug it in the system finds it and then adds it.  Fabulous product.","positive"
"Wow!","This product is amazing! I was frequently losing signal in my bedroom (the original modem/router was a couple of rooms away). When I wasn't losing signal I previously had 2-3Mbs download and 1-1.5Mbs upload speeds with 1-2 bar connection strength. Now I have a full connection strength throughout my entire 2000 square foot house with download speeds of 75-95 Mbs and upload speeds of 10-12 Mbs. These are very close to what I would have if I was physically wired to the modem. I even have 3 bar strength and fast speeds when on my patio (on the opposite side of the house from the modem). I'm so impressed! It took less than 30 minutes to set up (from when I started to open the box to having the entire mesh network running). I was hesitant to purchase because of the cost but this will save me so much time and frustration I shouldn't have waited. Websites now load almost immediately!","positive"
"Superb. What a modern home wifi system ought to be","Bought this 3-unit system to replace a failing (after only 4 months) CISCO RV320 router and some separate b/g/n access points. Unpacking and installation took only about 15 minutes including removing old equipment.  Setup including changing LAN SSID and IP ranges from default back to my previous LAN settings setting up about a dozen IP reservations and renaming some connections took perhaps 45 minutes including learning time. The system works perfectly coverage is outstanding (nowhere in the house is less than -60db) data rates are between 100 and 250+ Mbps for every connected device (my maximum internet download rate is only 80 Mbps so this is overkill!).  The iPhone app that controls it is excellent and lets me do things like see the current and historical (up to 60 days past) data usage up and down for every connected device and test the current up and down rates for each connected device. Works just fine with my parallel Sonosnet wireless music network – no interference on either net. Has lots of other features I don’t need like guest networks family restrictions UPnP IPv6 port forwarding bridge mode short-term priority settings and the like.I put one node in my media cabinet connected it (each mesh unit has two Ethernet ports) to a simple 5-port Ethernet switch and hardwired my Roku DVD player and receiver to it to bypass their less than stellar built-in wifi. Movie streaming is now perfect. HD movies require about 5-6 Mbps – and I am delivering 100+ Mbps with this setup. And besides all that the mesh units are small uncluttered unobtrusive and even stylish which my wife appreciates.","positive"
"Excellent product supported by a superior smart phone app","I have over 30 devices on my home network (something I found out courtesy of the Google app used to set up the mesh). My previous setup consisted of a Trendnet router a Securifi extender and a TP-Link extender. Wireless performance was erratic particularly with the Securifi which required rebooting a couple of times a week to regain access to wireless devices that had linked to it. Google's system was a simple drop in to replace all three. It does require using a smart phone app for the initial set up (Android in my case). I have to say the app is truly excellent and has a number of nifty features for testing mesh performance. I was tempted to just blast through the installation but decided to actually follow the step by step directions to make sure I didn't overlook anything. The app is really easy to use although a bit drawn out as the app checks repeatedly to determine the setup is going according to Hoyle. Whoever wrote it has a great grasp of how to keep an average user from getting confused. You simply plug in and hook up one of units to your modem then install the app (it won't install until there is a unit for it to find). That becomes your primary unit. Once it is set up the app asks if you have additional units and moves on to guide you through establishing them as satellites.  You have some neat checks you then run to see how well everything is working (and if you are getting the speed your ISP is promising).The only criticism I have is that the units only have 2 ethernet ports which meant I had to add an ethernet switch to the primary unit to be able to use the cable connections from 2 nearby computers and a VOIP (Ooma) box  a minor quibble since a good 5 port ethernet switch is less than $20.I'm hoping my days of seeing wifi failing while out of town are over. So far the Google mesh system performance is fantastic ... if it doesn't stay that way I'll revisit this review.","positive"
"Wow","This is the 3rd mesh wifi system I have installed in my house (the previous 2 being returned within days because of constant issues or inability to actually get them setup). I used to have the OnHub back in the day so I was already used to Google's Wifi app although it has been improved since I last used it.Let me just say not only was this a BREEZE to setup (a total of 3 nodes) but it works way better than I imagined it would! Again I have to stress that this was EXTREMELY EASY to setup. We've been using it for a few days and I have no complaints!If I had to think of some cons I would have to say 1) the lack of LAN ports (although not really that big of a deal since I've always had a switch next to my router) and 2) the inability to specify a different 5G SSID (again not big enough to affect my overall rating since I could just easily modify the 5 or so devices that were not set to the normal SSID).Get this mesh system for your home you will NOT be disappointed!","positive"
"very easy to install through the application","The bottom line: does the work as expected very easy to install through the application.And now my personal story:Since I live in Israel I decided to ask first Google if the router is multi voltage - or just 110 V (U.S.A). So I had a chat through the chat service of google. The very nice support people said that if I have to buy it from the U.K. - otherwise it would be only 110 V.Moreover the support people advised me not to buy it at all from 2 reasons: 1. It might not support the WiFi in my country. 2. Google doesn't give any support in Israel. Why I still decided to buy? Since I didn't believe that could be a WiFi problem (it is not so difficult to check there are specs of the router the support is quite universal). Moreover - I checked that I can download the app from the Play Store for my Android phone About the voltage I also had heavy doubts about the information I got but anyway there are voltage transformers available on the market...At the other hand The triple mesh router is much more expensive to buy from U.K. (Amazon).Conclusion: 1. The U.S.A. product comes with adaptive voltage (110-240). Only the plug is different one plug adapter costs $2.5.2. There was no need for any support to configure the 3 routers: I downloaded the App and followed the step-by-step instructions.3. It works like a charm.4. I would advise Google to check the knowledge of their support staff - the positive thing was that he was nice and helpful but...","positive"
"Had a terrible time using the iPhone app","Got it on prime day and installed it upon arrival. Had a terrible time using the iPhone app. Following the instructions were futile until I searched for solutions on google. One of the installation trouble shooter articles said to reboot the iPhone. That did the trick. They should tell you to reboot the installation device right at the beginning I could have saved a lot of time. Almost returned it. Now it runs great with maximum speed all throughout the house. The house is 5500 square feet and the speed is maximum at every corner. The signal is maximum at the pool 80 feet away from the house. I can surf all over the entire 1 acre property. Love this router.","positive"
"Truly Excellent.","I rarely write reviews on Amazon.  However having been through a few routers in the last few years with disappointing results I had to write how ecstatic I am with Google's WiFi mesh router system.  It's not the whole-home coverage - any mesh system of this price should pull that off.  It's the interface and the parental controls.  I can easily see every device on my network at any time from my phone.  Better yet I can see how much Internet bandwidth (though not network throughput) each device is using - and pause any device at-will.  I can also prioritize bandwidth usage giving priority to say the 4k Amazon program we're watching over the YouTube video my son is.  The parental controls are the best I've come across.  I can set up groups of devices and put them on schedules - and can pause those schedules if I need to.  The little mesh pods even look good!I suppose I could wish for more granular control over the firewall and I do wish I could measure actual network throughput - not just Internet usage.  But really I don't require the more granular firewall control and throughput would be useful for troubleshooting.  I haven't had any troubles though.  So maybe I don't need the feature to fix the problem that I'm not having.  The only real ding I have is the single ethernet port on each module.  It seems unreasonable to expect owners of this system to only need one wired connection to the router.  A small gigabit switch handily solves the problem but for $300 I'd like a few more ports.All told I can't imagine being this excited this pleased by a router. Yet here I am.  Great work Google.","positive"
"The best WiFi money can buy","We previously had Apple Time Capsule 3TB ME182LL/A [NEWEST VERSION] and a router that Verizon was claimed was fast enough for their gigabit FIOs service. Both had issues reaching certain parts of my 2200 sq ft house. Google WiFi has none of those problems. Connectivity is consistent enough that I do not have to think about it. The app is also miles ahead of what I am used to when it comes to managing wifi. I am still able to use my Apple Time Capsule for backups by connecting it to one of the wifi devices. I also am able to connect my Samsung 4G LTE Network Extender Verizon Wireless Cellular Signal Booster  SLS-BU103 to the Google wifi device closest to my office and since then I have had much better phone reception. Just buy it!","positive"
"Works Seamlessly!","I work in IT and pretty tech savvy but the setup of Google Wifi was so easy that for a second I had to think if I followed all the instructions! I was done setting up all 3 routers in less than 15 minutes. Google goes out of their way to make sure you know exactly what you are doing every step of the setup (they even explain what a modem is).I initially got the Google Wifi system to combat a problem I was having with my ISP Issued router. I live in a 2000+ sqft home with an open floor plan. Recently I had begun adding a bunch of smart devices around the house (switches smart lock Amazon Echo (3) smart plugs etc...). When you couple all those new smart devices with phones tablets laptops TVs etc... already in the house I had over 20 devices connected to 1 WiFi Access Point!What ended up happening was that although the signal was good in every room the WiFi connection would randomly drop or I would get an IP Configuration Error on one of the devices. It seems as though all of the device signals were overlapping and causing the bottle neck to be at the access point. I was able to prove this by confirming that the closer I got to the router the more reliable the connection got even without a noticeable change in signal strength.Google Wifi solves this problem by allowing me to setup the mesh network to blanket the entire home. I can now move room to room and my devices automatically connect to the Google Router with the best connection. All while using the same SSID seamlessly. Unlike an extender which requires you to setup the extender using a different SSID and forces devices to have to drop its previous connection to connect to the new SSID Google Wifi allows you to use the same SSID for all of its routers.Google Wifi is smart enough to distinguish which devices should use 2.4 GHz and which should use 5.0 GHz. This now also eliminates the need to manage 2 sets of SSIDs. When managing so many devices it is hard to keep up with which require 2.4 GHz which require 5.0 GHz each with its own SSID. Google Wifi lets you setup one SSID and it allows the device to connect using its default frequency.All of this is managed from an app on your phone so you no longer need to worry about navigating to 192.168.0.1 or 10.0.0.1 and remembering the default username and password. Google Wifi is linked to your Google account you can add multiple admins and manage your network via an app and manage the network remotely.Google took a usually complicated concept like mesh networking and made it work and easy to setup.The entire thing was super easy to setup and solved the problem I was having.Super happy with this purchase!","positive"
"Worth. Every. Penny.","I was skeptical of paying $300 for this product without anyone I know using them. I got these home and was pretty blown away.My house is 2900sq ft 2 stories with a large 4 car attached garage.1. The unboxing was very nice the kit is very Apple like in its kitting. Very simple and straightforward. It was impressive the way it was laid out.2. The instructions didn't waste a bunch of time it was simple and in layman terms.3. The units go together so smoothly. I connected the first unit ran the installation process on my phone to setup the network and check connection. This process took about 10 minutes to do which is excellent in my mind.4. The additional units went in with ease as well each one took around 5-7 minutes for boot up and connection to the network.All in even with reading the documentation thoroughly and testing my network throughout the house I spent about 45 minutes getting things setup. I have a 150Mbps connection on a Docsis 3.0 modem and I am averaging a 70Mbps speed test everywhere in my house. No wireless router combination I tried would cover this layout and I was at my wits end with wi-fi my family was about to mutiny on me. This trio solved every single issue anyone had. We now have rock solid connection with great speeds. These units even offer the ability to tie in hardwired ethernet connections which I also took advantage of.","positive"
"Best Router I have ever owned!","This might be the best wireless router I have ever owned. It was super simple to set up using the app. I have complete coverage and consistent speed in all parts of my house now. My only issue was the lack of Ethernet ports for wired devices but that was remedied with a cheap switch I purchased. (You can also use an old router as a switch according to what I have read)Google WiFi includes a feature called Family WiFi which allows you to pause specific devices - great for kids. It also includes a Guest WiFi feature. I have not had to use these 2 features but assuming they work as intended.I love  the detail this router provides shows you which devices are connected how much data they are using in real time in the past day 7 days 30 days etc.You can control the LED light on each individual access point and lower them as needed.You can reboot individual access points or all of them at one time.You can test your internet connection the mesh connection and the speed.You can even use the app when you aren't home!I could go on and on about this thing but compared to the routers I have owned previously (Asus Netgear Linksys) this is by far the best and easiest to use.If you are on the fence about price but you already have spent over $100-$150 on a router only for it to STILL suck... try this out - you won't be disappointed.","positive"
"Regular routers is so yesterday and mesh wifi is the future!","I had a powerful tri-band wireless N router that I was using for a while which was good and also used powerline adapters to provide a gap in coverage however just like any router after a few years it becomes unreliable.  I was skeptical about mesh-based wifi thinking it is just a bunch of repeaters (which never worked for me) so I gave Google Wifi a chance.  First off it was so easy to set up just scan the barcode and follow the prompts on your smartphone.  Do note everything will need to be configured through a smartphone app (no web browser support) but in a way that makes this product more secure.  Once I set up (2) of these across my 1500 sq. ft home it worked perfectly and the far end of my home I got faster bandwidth as if I was right next to the main router.  If you are suffering through inconsistent coverage and/or dealing with multiple solutions consider Google mesh Wifi as your one-stop solution.","positive"
"and it's fine. Pros","I'll make this quick and simple for those that don't want to do a lot of research.I bought this because Verizon's router in the basement did not cover the entire house and other time the signal would drop.  TV was hooked up to Chromecast on the far end of the house and I usually had no luck connecting.This device fixed that issue.  I get full bar all around the house and the app on my phone lets me run speed test and diagnosis to know how the network is doing and it's fine.Pros:Extremely easy to install. Took no effort and knowledge.  So none of my basic networking knowledge came handy and couldn't impress my wife.Cons:None to note so far accept that the price dropped in less than a month and I have no way of asking amazon for a refund.  If someone knows please let me know.","positive"
"Wow!","I rarely take the time to review but had to in this case!  I was having major network issues using the cable supplied modem/router. Ongoing problems with speakers Smart TVs while streaming Netflix and a  a terrible dead spot in the bonus room over the garage where my office printer etc are located. (I didn’t have any issues connecting my HP printer as some other reviews  stated.)Once I got these set up it was like magic!! Months of frustration and constantly wanting to smash electronics just vanished! :). My house is approximately 2800 sq feet and I placed one on the first and second floors and one in the basement.All devices stay online and the previous dead zone no longer exists. I checked my network speed on the Netflix app before and it was 34. With these little nuggets of awesomeness.....it’s now 64. Yesss!","positive"
"Do it. You won't regret it.","So I had to return this item to Amazon because the first was damaged (probably during shipping sounded like a baby rattle).But I got another and was all set to go.  Setup was super easy (and fun).  Three hubs blanket Wifi over all 3 levels and 3200 sq ft very easily.  Love the parental features to shut off devices at any given time or schedule and the app is terrific.  You can see at any time your WiFi setup how many devicesthe current speeds and any other data like the mesh connectivity.These completely replaced the Quantum router from Verizon using the cat6 from the ONT.  The only thing that is odd and I have verified this with a friend of mine with the same setup and GIGABIT speed but in a different area that the Google WiFi only seems to max out around 600-700mps on a good day.  Average is about 500mps.  The Quantum router would never give you speeds above 250mps on the 5ghz band but would max out around 950-970mps at the router.  That being said your devices are now connecting optimally at all points in your house and that 600-700 is being used more now than the Quantum's 950 ever did.  I've recommended this to many family and friends already.","positive"
"Very nice and yes it works with Uverse","This is a good product.  If you already have Ethernet connections wire as many satellites as you can.  It makes a huge difference in download and upload speeds.For Uverse you must add the Google WIFI principal point first into your existing network and get an IP address.  After that you can set the Uverse router in DMZ mode (point the DMZ to your principal point and kill your Uverse wifi).  If your Uverse TV boxes are on Coax you are good to go.  If they are on Ethernet you have to make sure they are plugged into the Uverse router and not the Google Wifi principal point (or any switches you may have downstream).It works.","positive"
"Fantastic Router.  Gave my whole house internet even in the far corners of my backyard.  Look no further spend the money.","Love me some Google Wifi 3 pack.  The comcast internet guy showed up and was like no way you have the rolls royce of wifi routers here.  These are fantastic.  You will have no problem getting internet throughout your house.  Popped them out of the box plugged the first one into the cable modem downloaded the app over 4 g.  Setup could not have been easier.  Scan the qr code name your network set a password spinning home logo for a couple of minutes then bam.  Fast internet.  1 down plug in and do the same with the other 2 except join a network.  Spinning home logo and bam internet throughout the house even in the corner of the backyard over 100 feet away.  Fantastic simply fantastic.  If you are looking for internet throughout your house look no further spend the money and never look back or get dropped wifi.  I used to get dropped when going between router and extender.  Mesh network is the fix.  Super easy to set up a guest network.  Go into the app select guest network name password... bam.  You can also do all sorts of crazy things like set times for things or drop something off your network.  Good to know if the neighbor is using my guest network.  Just make sure you only give guests the guest network password and not the main.","positive"
"Finally wifi that works!","Best money I've spent on networking.One router wasn't sufficient for my single-family home.  I had been running a router on each floor to provide even coverage.  This sort of setup worked but was a big hassle to maintain.The Google system works fantastically well.  The first puck acts as the router and the remaining can connect wirelessly or be wired to the first puck.  Setup is easy and quick.  Network management is straightforward and is done using an app on the phone.  You can create a guest network do port forwarding assign fixed IP addresses.  You can't change the IP range to 192.168 if that's important.  You can't use another company's router and have the Google mesh features: the first puck needs to be the router.One point to make on setup is that you should disable the router and wifi you already have.  If you have a combined modem/router/wifi setup from the cable company all you want running is the modem.  Let the Google wifi handle routing and wifi.  Two router/wifi systems running at the same time can cause headaches especially if the wifi networks have the same name.Some power users note this system lacks certain features.  I'd say my setup is moderately complicated and the Google system works great.  I use multiple switches and wired backhaul and all of my devices work great with excellent speeds.Switches are a cheap and easy way to add wired connections if they're needed.  You'll want an unmanaged switch.  8 port units are less than $30 here on Amazon.I've been running this setup for a few months now and it's been rock solid.  No need to reboot everything just keeps working.  This product has definitely paid for itself in the time and headache it's saved me from keeping my old setup running.1 year update: the system continues to be very reliable.  I've had zero problems with it. The guest network feature works well.  My only complaint is that I'd like WiFi calling to work more reliably.  Overall I still have no issues recommending the system.","positive"
"Best home WiFi gear I've ever seen!  Outstanding app can replace many paid services too!","These little devices are the best I've ever seen at keeping my WiFi strong fast and free of dead zones!  Their ability to mesh network and always find optimal channels results in the fastest WiFi I've ever seen in my fairly large and old house (4000 sq ft built in 1926).In the past two years I've been through several sets of wireless routers.  First there was the Arris modem & router that I bought to use with my home system.  If I was lucky I'd get ~ 26mb/s if I was close to it and less than 8mb/s if I was upstairs in my bedroom.  Then after reading reviews I bought the Asus AC1900.  This was supposed to save all my problems.  I saw no improvement over the Arris modem and the speeds were the same.  Oh...turns out I needed to try and exploit my 5GHz channel to try and get higher than 30mb/s.  Then the Asus AC1900 burnt out and it was useless.  Next I tried the Netgear Nighthawk and while I occasionally saw speeds up to 41mb/s it wasn't delivering ANY strength to the upstairs of my house.  At this time I was switching between home internet service with a peak of either 30mb/s or 45mb/s.Cue the Google hardware.  I immediately started getting 48mb/s all through my ground floor and about 41mb/s upstairs (using a total of 5 devices).  I switched to 75mb/s home wifi last week and now I'm getting 88mb/s close to my hub and 81mb/s throughout the rest of the house.  This system is great!Additionally there are many great controls within the Google app that help me manage device usage and scheduling - an important consideration with my kids (ages 12 and 15).  I can put them on a diet as to how much time they get online each day and it's dead simple to set up guest networks and control access on a device-by-device basis.  The Google app has really intuitive scheduling services and it also allows me to share network access with guests via texts email etc.  The scheduling and access functions can in many ways take the place of paid services or extra devices such as Disney's Circle.I'm incredibly impressed by this system.  It's about time someone made home networking gear that anyone can use and where you don't need to be a networking engineer to configure and run the system!","positive"
"Google Wifi System... I now have SUPER WiFi!!!","Google Wifi.  I had been waiting for a year to get this as I was hoping the cost would go down a little bit.  Since the price was lowered to $265 I decided to pull the trigger.  Then when I was checking out I got an offer to apply for an Amazon Prime Visa card and receive an instant $70 gift card!  So it ended up costing me $195 plus tax for the set of three!First the packaging.  Now I'm a stickler for awesome product packaging and Google Wifi did not disappoint.  The unboxing experience was very satisfying and incredibly simple as was the install.  Now my house is only about 1400 square feet and according to the box I would technically only need one puck but I wanted my house blanketed in sweet blazing fast wifi so I installed all three.  Set-up was ridiculously easy.  You hook-up the first puck to your modem download the Google Wi-fi app and it recognizes your first puck and connects to it.  Then you walk around your house and install the second puck the same way.  Just plug it into power and the app will find it and connect to it.  Repeat again for the third puck.  Once all three pucks are installed and the app has found them it links all three of them via the mesh network.  The entire set-up and linking process took about 10-15 minutes.  Once it was done you can use the app to check internet speed wifi speed and how good the mesh network is communicating with each puck.So with three pucks installed in my measly 1400 sf house I am now happy to say that I indeed have SUPER WIFI in my home.  No matter where I am in my house my devices all have a 100% full-strength signal.  The signal never even dips down some it's always full strength.  Every single nook and cranny that I can check produces the same results.  I have a smart tv in my living room that loads and plays youtube videos instantly now.  My ps4 connects to the network just as fast as when it was wired.  And you can even hardwire devices directly to the google pucks as well.  My main puck that connects to my modem is also hard wired to my pc.  And my ADT ihub in my living room is plugged directly into one of my other pucks.  I now also have almost 100% full strength wifi in my backyard around my pool area.So in closing I could not be any happier with my purchase.  I waited a long time to get this system and I cannot even believe that I only paid $195 for three pucks.  Unboxing and set-up was a breeze and actually enjoyable.  Wifi is blazing fast.  And I love the complete control from the app... no pc needed.  So happy!","positive"
"The best option I’ve found for whole house coverage!","Over the years I’ve has almost every possible configuration of routers known to mankind!  My home isn’t huge but it is smart - lighting thermostat security cams voice commands and a lot of wireless IoT in 2800 sf. I was skeptical of the new mesh networking and did a ton of research on each before making the decision to go with Google WiFi.This was most likely the easiest setup of a network ever!  You configure the primary access point and connect the other two - place them in the best areas of your home and you have wall to wall coverage!  After testing everything and configuring the app I sat back and enjoyed what I had never had before NO DEAD SPOTS!From start to finish it was about 30 minutes to configure everything.The Google app takes speed measurements and lets me know how things are doing. You don’t need to worry about 2.4 v 5 GHz devices because it is all seamless. You can prioritize a device for an hour or longer and see how your mesh is working on the app at any time. Another bonus is having a wired port available to you in other rooms (I have a wired weather station that requires it).It is super easy to configure your guest network and set rules also.I’ve had them running for about 6 weeks now and no issues at all. In face I am getting faster speeds than before (about 20% more).  I’m very impressed with how well this is working for me!","positive"
"BEST WIFI ROUTER EVER!!!","This replaced my TP-Link Router and Range Extender. Best Wifi system ever. This system setup in 2 minutes. All I had to do was disconnect my existing router and range extender install the Google Wifi app on my phone plug the Google units in and scan the QR codes. The app found the Google units on its own and installed the mesh system very quickly and easily. I no longer have any dead zones in my condo and the speeds are super fast in each room. Each Google unit only has one ethernet port to use for devices so I used that one ethernet port for a 5 plug switch and hardwired 5 pieces of equipment on each unit I use the wifi strickly for the laptop computers cell phones tablets and guest network.","positive"
"Great Wifi router system","Just installed the Google Wifi mesh system about 24 hours ago and I am really impressed with the results.  Big signal strength and speed improvement over my previous system of Apple Airport Extreme routers; which I thought were pretty good.Easy installation IF you simply follow the prompts and instructions.  Three point system up and running in less than 30 minutes and I wasn't in any hurry.  Speed checked on several speed tests and seems to improve with time as the software analyzes the system.Just for comparison I ran several speed tests between the Google system and the wifi router built into the Arris modem provided by my ISP and the improvement was astonishing.I researched this system for a long while before buying on Amazon when the price dropped.  I would definitely recommend. Strong signals all over my home with basement.  So far so good.","positive"
"Good buy!","Wow! Great buy. My two story home was having problems with WiFi throughout the home. I can truly say that our problems have been solved. Google wifi is top of the line. 1 device is enough for my home. We use to buffer a lot but no more. Set up was very easy and I like being able to monitor from my phone. I can set priority devices to get the most transmission therefore my TVs get more transmission. I have been cable free for 3 years now and buffering was an issue. Not anymore. This is a good buy for those who stream.","positive"
"This is not true for this great product. I followed the instructions and the wifi ...","I had a traditional wifi hub before and while it worked it was ugly did not cover my entire house well and significant work to setup when I first got it. This is not true for this great product. I followed the instructions and the wifi was up in no time. I then moved the two extra routers around the house to find how to best cover the house and voila. My 16 year old teenager is finally happy that she has good wifi in her room. Worst case I can always add another one if I need it. Speed has been great. I get my full 100Meg if the device is connected to the router but I still get over 70Meg for all other connections which is plenty. The one limitation is the routers only have two Ethernet ports and the one connected to the modem will only have one extra. This means you have to add a switch if you need more connections. On one of them I have a 1Gig 8 port hub but it was easy to hide. I also really like that they look great no matter where you place them. I don't have to come up with innovative ways to hide my tech with these. My wife is happy even if I place it on any furniture in plain sight. Great product.","positive"
"I have the best WiFi coverage I've ever had and it's so simple a five year old could set it up.  It just WORKS!!","We've suffered with crappy WiFi coverage in our house for years and kept throwing different stuff at it ... wired WiFI extenders (running wire was a PITA) wireless WiFi extenders etc.  This is THE solution!  I didn't even have to read the directions to set it up and can cover installation in just a couple steps:1.  Download the Google WiFi app to your phone (all setup is done through the app on your phone)2.  Take one of the pucks (they're all the same so just pick one):  plug it into power and plug the Ethernet cable into your cable modem3.  Open the app and follow very simple instructions to set up.4.  Situate the two other pucks throughout the house plug them into power one at a time and walk through the setup steps on the appYou're DONE.  If you have older relatives who ask you for help with their internet issues GET THIS.  You can manage multiple networks from the same app on your phone ... can test the network can restart the pucks etc. all REMOTELY!I have the best WiFi coverage I've ever had at my house and didn't have any of the stress of figuring out all the geek stuff.  It just works.","positive"
"It just works... and works well! So much better than a normal WiFi system.","WiFi Mesh is simply the way to go! I struggled with my AT&T wireless router.... could not get coverage into certain spots in my home off the one unit. Tried using WiFi repeaters but they slow down the bandwidth and are not a perfect solution for expanding traditional WiFi.I installed my Google WiFi mesh system 2 months ago.... I am writing this review because I realized when explaining what I had to a friend that my WiFi is no longer an issue in any way shape or form. My Google WiFi simply works in every part of my home. I have one unit out in my detached garage and am amazed how well it works so far away.... when my AT&T router could barely reach the kitchen door leading towards the garage.My only issue now is the reliability of AT&T fiber. I have a 100mb service that works great 95% of the time... but drops and short outages at key times really get under my skin!Setup is simple the app is simple.... no worries there. But two months later all of it is out of mind because I don't have to mess with it. It just works and works well. And that is all I care about!","positive"
"All the WiFi I need!","This Wifi system is exactly what I was looking for! The setup was a breeze and the signal strength is out of this world compared to my previous Almond router. The app is easy to navigate and explains the setup process step by step. I also have a security camera system that was originally plugged into an extender but one of these hubs took care of that problem and with ease. If you want to stop or pause WiFi to a particular device (ie. Kids iPad) just click a button and it’s offline. Perfect for dinner time. Also if there are any connection issues the app lets you know and ways to correct it. This system is well worth the money and I would absolutely buy it again!","positive"
"I can't believe I waited so long to get this...","I have struggled with my home internet connection for 4 years.  I'm in a 3 story 3100 sq ft house with the internet connection coming into the basement and was running the Airport Extreme and Airport Express since I have a mac and iphones.  Doing speed tests I would get 100M and over in the basement and it would drop to 10M on the 2nd floor and almost non-existent on the 3rd floor.I installed these in about 30 minutes from including unboxing time reading instructions (which there are minimal since it's mostly app guided) and  placement of these devices on 3 floors.  Setup was extremely easy - just follow the directions on the screen.  Depending on how strong your cell signal is I might suggest downloading the Google Wifi app prior to disconnecting your existing wifi.  My app took a while to download because I have weak cell signal.I just tested my speed (from my office which is 30 miles away) and it's 208Mbps download and 9.2 upload.  We tested the other night and our house had 2 xbox's playing online simultaneously and a Skype call going on and we had flawless connection and speeds.  I haven't enabled all of the features yet with family time etc but I'm extremely satisfied with this system!","positive"
"Can work with Actiontec Fios router (with some effort)","I have internet and tv through Frontier (FIOS) which meant that needed to use their provided Actiontec MW424WR router. In fact with my set-up Frontier was running both internet and tv through the same coax cable. I wanted better control of my WiFi network and I was also interest in the mesh technology of this product. However due to my setup there were a lot of things I had to change. First off I had to run a Cat5 cable from my router to the ONT box in the garage. Then I had to contact Frontier and have them change the ONT box (remotely) so that internet went through the Cat5 and tv went through the coax. They also needed to implement a Moca connection within the ONT.After that I logged into my Actiontec router turned off the wifi broadcast and released the IP address. The Google Wifi took over the ethernet connection got set up and now the Actiontec sits behind the Google Wifi and is basically just a bridge making sure that my tv programming and on-demand stuff gets pushed to the cablebox. That set up isn't supported by Frontier but that's the only way to get the Google WiFi system to operate correctly as a mesh network. There were a couple more steps involved but that's the basic idea.I love the functionality of this router and being able to turn off wifi to my kids' devices on a schedule (or at whim). The guest network was also a breeze to set up. I'm only using two units right now but I have significantly more coverage than I used to.","positive"
"This Mesh Router Rocks !!  Too bad there isn't a six star choice !!","Love this mesh router!My home of 3500 sf has a partial basement on sloping lake front property.  The man cave and  spare bedroom are downstairs.  All of my audio eqpt music collection (classical of course) and modem and router are downstairs.I had a Linksys router that simply was too wimpy for this house.  I had continual dropouts at the kitchen table where I enjoy reading news on my Amazon HD 10 Tablet (which is also a total winner product).  There were many dead spots in the house and the garage had no coverage at all.I ordered the Google Router  not knowing what to expect.  I have great respect for Google for their expertise is extremely high tech and clearly  evident via Google Earth Android and other gigantic creations.  I am an EE and maybe better to positioned to appreciate Google's triumphs than most are.So the router arrives.  I was very disappointed in that it comes  with no manual or written instructions at all.  You are a bit on your own..  you must deduce everything from the app.  I hope this review inspires them to include a manual in the future.  Its a super product shame if sales potential were  inhibited due to this obvious cost cutting oversight.  I am sure there are potential customers that need a bit  more help.So I placed the first router unit downstairs where the cable comes in  This is the obvious place for  the  modem and router.  The second router unit goes upstairs near the flatscreen.  I am using the second unit to also provide ethernet to the Tivo box. as well as cover one side of the house.  The third router unit is on  the other side of the house to cover that end and the garage.After setting up I shifted unit 3 some to optimize coverage.  (Be sure to do a system reset if you move a unit).The results.. using the wifi signal strength indicator  on my HD 10 tablet I have walked the entire house including closets and garage.  I have not found a place where  the wifi signal is less than four bars !!  There used to be many places that were so weak you either had dropouts or  unable to connect at all.  All of upstairs were 2 bars or less.My enthusiasm is huge..  you will love this product made by a company that has  heavy duty engineering muscle !","positive"
"The thing that really makes this system great is the phone app","I purchased a three pack initially then added a single unit to bolster coverage to our garage.  The thing that really makes this system great is the phone app.  It guides you through setup nicely (DO follow the advice of others and setup the satellites close to the main unit initially THEN figure out their final location).The phone app lets you test the signal strength at each unit individually.  It also gives you lots of fun information about your network whether you're home on the network or not.  You can test your internet speed see the satellite units(which you can label Kitchen Master Bedroom etc.) and test their connection strength.  You can also pull up all the connected devices and even see which satellite they're connected to.  So I can see who's at home based on whether or not their phone is connected and even know which part of the house they're in.  I know kind of stalkerish but also useful and fun!Though the fun stuff is easily accessible one doesn't have to have any network knowledge otherwise:  Google wifi automatically optimizes the connections and bands for you.  Super easy.  After messing around in the past trying to get good coverage in our house using a router extended wireless access points etc. it's nice to have a solution that works so effortlessly.","positive"
"Excellent device covers my 5k Sq Ft House - Many Switches","I have a 5k sq ft house and previously I had 2 routers for the entire house.  I would have a deadspot in my office and barely any reception outside.  If I put the router in my office I wouldn't get reception in large parts of the house.  Also my wifi had 2 different SSID so it would be a constant struggle to pick the one with the best reception.I have experience installing mesh devices at my commercial properties but wanted a solution for my home.I thought about the Netgear Orbi device but the reviews showed that it was hit or miss.  The Google Wifi on the other hand had largely glowing reviews and was cheaper.  The biggest con for the google devices from reviewers was that it wasn't tri-band.Tri-band was not necessary for me because all 3 locations I needed it for had ethernet run to it from my main data room.Installation was a little trickier than I expected.  As I was doing backhaul installation vs just mesh it seemed to have difficulty detecting the devices for some reason.  I had to kind of experiment going back and forth between connected devices and non-connected ones.  I think it detects based on bluetooth.I imagine it might be easier to install if you start off with all the devices in the same room instead of going to where they ultimately will be installed at.I had many devices that were hardwired and required 4 switches.You also have to make sure that all your devices are AFTER the google Wifi if you want them to be on the same subnet.My network topography looks like this..Router => Google Wifi Primary => Old Netgear R7000 Router in AP Mode (Access Point Mode) => Google Wifi => Switch => Google Wifibeyond each switch there are multiple other switches.I like how within the app I can see how much data each connected device is using in realtime and historical.As I have poor cellphone reception in my house my calls now perform much better as I stay on the same SSID with full bars going from room to room.  Whereas before I would have to run to the room with the strongest reception on my current connection.Overall very satisfied with the google wifi - one of my better purchases recently.CONS:The only con that I can think of right now is the lack of ports.  I really do wish that it had more network ports so I don't have to buy switches.  I'm not sure how much more the product would cost with more ports but it would be handy vs just the 2 ports it has.  Since I use them in backhaul mode meaning they arent meshing together 1 port is used for the backhaul and the other to a switch.  If it had 4 ports then i most likely dont need switches for at least 1 of themIts almost as good as the bamboo sheets from Hotel Sheets Direct :)","positive"
"Easy set up seems to be exactly what we needed","Gave up on my Apple Airport always crapping our. Someone suggested NetGear but the reviews scared me so I defaulted to what amazon suggested and we haven’t been disappointed! I’m a technologically inept exhausted mother of 3 and we live in a large brick home. We’ve always had issues with the Airport reaching Either end of our home the basement or more than 5 feet from the front door. I realize it could have simply been too small of a unit for my expectations but I was constantly having to reset it until one day none of our devices could find it. I did everything to reset/reboot/restart. It just quit working overnight. Enter Google. It took me 15 minutes to set the whole thing up. It’s idiot-proof on set up and we have great Wifi coverage. Which is important when you’re paying over $60/mo for internet.","positive"
"WiFi Done Right and Made Simple","Since the dawn of wifi I've been one of those people that somehow perpetually lives in places where wireless networks aren't as simple as they should be. I have way more experience than I would like to have had with DD-WRT and the old blue Linksys routers and access points creating bridged networks running ethernet cables through ceilings to try to mitigate distance with wires instead of wireless ethernet through power outlets and heaps of other workarounds because it just won't work out of the box. All of this to say I'm fairly tech-literate and have been able to create solutions but it's never been simple or easy for the layperson.My current condo is a perfect one bedroom two story 1000 sq ft space with cable for modem downstairs and despite the small size of the condo just enough shielding between the first and second floor to make for abysmal wifi upstairs. Built in the 70s it lacks any original in-wall cabling and after spending hours trying to get WAPs work last year I gave up and just ran an ethernet cable up the stairwell with tape planning to run it in a wall during an eventual remodel.Then mesh wifi happened and after watching the very positive reports for a few months I jumped on two of the Google routers. One sits next to the cable modem at my desk near the bottom of the stairs the other sits on a handrail at the top of the stairs. For the first time in my life I experienced out of the box plug-and-play success with wireless internet.The app is simple and easy to understand and I appreciate the ability to view what's happening with my network from anywhere in the world. Enable and disable devices create priorities check network health it's all at the touch of a finger.One of the reasons I went with Google's system is that each router has the ability to be the primary connected to the modem but also includes a LAN plug for wired devices. My original Xbox One has a pretty awful wireless card and won't pull more than 30 Mbps even with direct line of sight to a router. With Google's system the Xbox is plugged into the second mesh router enabling wired performance over a wireless connection.Goodbye complex internet and hello It just works!","positive"
"our wifi is pretty much dead","This is my 2nd review of any products that I have bought through Amazon. Our internet provider is comcast with 220Mbps down and 10 ups. Home is 4 bedrooms with 1420sqft.14 devices(4 iPhones 2 PS4 2 Xbox One 4 PCs 2 Amazon Fire TV) total connected through either Wifi or the powerline. Among the users we have 2 heavy users for gaming 1 streaming video and 1 light user.My old setting setting is Arris Surfboard SB6141 and TP Link  AC 1900 with 2 different wifi setting 2.4 and 5. Most days are ok but if somebody downloads a game our wifi is pretty much dead. Our modem and router is located in the 3rd room (far left corner) adjacent to master bedroom and bedroom #2. Wifi speed in 3rd bedroom was about 120/10 and our kitchen is about 25ft away (through walls and 1 door) with 40Mbps.Bad: I have to switch my wifi to 2.4 when I am in the kitchen doing dishes. Our PCs would only get 20/5.New setting: same modem with Google Wifi 3 packs. Yes it is an overkill setting for such 1400sqft house. Setting is very easy through their app. Google wifi #1 is the bedroom and the other 2 are in bedrooms 1 and 2 (these rooms belong to gamers). Nothing in the master bedroom. Between Google wifi the distance is about 10 ft and a drywall.Result: wifi in bedroom 3 is about 216/10 and kitchen is 80/7 (this time we did need to change the wifi since Google combines both into one (so convenient!). Now we still have wifi while someone downloads a game....yes!Overall my whole house has a reliable wifi and the gamers don't bother us anymore about lagging. At the moment we have an additional 2 people staying over and we have a total of 18 devices connected. Still gaming and streaming !!!I It was more affordable than Eero and Orbi.Yes Google wifi 3 packs is an overkill setting but peace in mind.If you are hesitant give them a try.","positive"
"A great Wifi system at a great price especially if you use wired backhaul","I've been using this 3 pack of Google Wifi for a couple months now with Gigabit service from Midco and they have been working great!Before these I had a single Netgear wireless router which didn't cover my whole house and backyard very well... while I would have signal everywhere in the house with the Netgear that signal was weak in some areas especially downstairs. Since my house is pretty small it surprised me that I had signal issues downstairs with devices that were only 15 feet or so away from the Netgear... but with 2 walls and an old thick hardwood floor in between it was enough to cause significant signal loss. My Fire TV Stick would buffer half the time only 15 feet away.I looked at several different Mesh Wifi systems from Orbi Velop to Eero before I settled on Google Wifi. While some of these other system like the Velop are faster and have more advanced features I just had a hard time justifying the price of the other systems. It really came down to the Velop and Google Wifi for me. I really liked being able to still using web management and the advanced networking features with Velop but at double the price for the Velop I realized it wasn't worth it because in reality I really don't use any of those advances at the moment... it was a nice thing to have just incase.So I got this pack of Google Wifi and I put one of them upstairs and another downstairs and then the third one I put in my shed to cover the backyard and my fire pit. I hardwired all three of these Google Wifi points so backhaul doesn't need to use Wifi which gives me a consistent 400Mbs download speeds next to all three points. There wasn't a strong enough signal out to my shed for that point to get decent wireless backhaul speeds which is another reason why I wanted to hardwire everything. Now my whole house and backyard is completely covered with good Wifi... anywhere in my house and backyard I'm getting at least 200Mbs download speeds. I'm getting these speeds on a Pixel XL phone using the Ookla app for speed tests to the internet.","positive"
"... a week since the purchase and I am 100% satisfied. Have been plagued with slow wifi connections","It has been a week since the purchase and I am 100% satisfied.  Have been plagued with slow wifi connections dead spots etc. in my small 1200-sq.ft apartment for a couple of years now.  My ISP provides a consistent 200 mbps connection .  So I knew it had to be the wifi router but hesitated to make the switch because my old router too was a branded dual band one.Anyway finally I took the plunge - and am I delighted!  The set up is a breeze and is very transparent - all you need is an android/apple phone.  In addition to helping you set up the connections the phone app also gives you a clear picture of the devices connected how many are active which one to give preference to (if needed) etc.Just so you know - you can only connect one additional device to the main (base) router and 2 (max) to the additional satellite extenders.  So If you have many wired connections you may want to purchase an Ethernet splitter.  Very effective inexpensive ones are available in Amazon - TP Link recommended.  So I do not think of this as a con at all.The overall connection is Your Existing Modem to Google Wifi Router (base) to Ethernet Splitter to Your Wired Connection Devices.Oh btw against my 200mbps connection from the ISP I am getting ~170Mbps signal strength on all my wifi connected devices (per speedtest.net by Ookla).I highly recommend the product.I know these are early days.  Will update if anything changes","positive"
"Awesome home wireless solution that is simple to set up.","These replace a Netgear Nighthawk x6 WAP.  The ease of setup was astonishing in it's quickness and simplicity.  I thought I liked all the features on my prior Nighthawk but in reality the config time and complexity of using them made them pointless as I never really used them.  Three of these were cheaper than two of the new Netgear Orbi mesh product and I wanted better and simpler coverage than my prior Nighthawk WAP and extender solution.  20 minutes after unboxing I had really good coverage all over my 2 story plus basement house on 5 GHz band and automatic switching to 2.4 Ghz in my yard I had a second guest network limiting access to some resources.  No more manually switching between 5 and 2.4 in weak signal areas.  This is an awesome complete wireless solution with very little complexity and outstanding performance.","positive"
"Excellent wifi router choice for large or multistory home or small business","So far results have been excellent.  I have a tri level house where coverage has always been an issue even using a repeater.

I have connected HD video DVRs at eack of the 3 locations and can share files with the other 2 locations.Setup and management via my smartphone is very convenient.I recommend this product to anyone setting up a home system or a small business system.

"Works well once your xfinity modem is not in bridge mode.","June 23 2017 - Google Wifi system (set of 3) - Router replacement for whole home coverageI had been using Linksys EA7500 with my Xfinity modem in bridge mode.  The Linksys was getting Internet so I figured all I had to do was unplug it and plug the Google Wifi in.  After MANY restarts using two different Google Wifi devices and two different Internet cable I ended up to a hard restart of the Xfinity modem (hold the reset button in for 20 or 30 seconds)  You still will not get Internet till you log into the modem and set up Wifi. One all that was done setting up the Google Wifi was pretty easy.  The ONLY interface is through the phone app.  There is no web interface to the system.  You get one hardwired Internet (LAN) port so you will need a switch if you had several things connected to an existing router.Each additional Google Wifi device simply plugs in for power and then uses the phone app to join the network and become part of the mesh.  (You can control the brightness of the light on each device and even turn the light off if in a bedroom.  It would be kind of nice to have a schedule to turn the light off at night and then on during the day.)I had very spotty Wifi in the garage to an irrigation controller and weak signal in one guest bedroom and all locations have much better signal now.Early days so we will see how things go over time.","positive"
"Wifi is the best and the setup and use is easy!","I bought the three pack of Google Wifi and a new Linksys comcast compatible modem with no wifi because the house I live in has had bad internet for the past 1.5 years. The modem seemed unable to deal with all the wireless requirements in the house. I live upstairs and it was really bad. Could not sometimes get enough bandwidth to do web and email let alone streaming on my Roku TV. I tried installing two powerline ethernet devices which helped for awhile but other house mates soon wanted the same and we started having issues again. I decided for the peace and sanity of all I would buy the wifi system and install it. I placed one by the new linksys modem one by the downstairs bedrooms for those house mates and then one upstairs by the bedrooms. In about 30 minutes i was done and an initial speed test that the application on my Nexus 6p android phone showed we had stable bandwidth all over the house at significantly greater speeds. The other part was stability of the signal. Before we had these modem issues where the internet would slow and we had to reset the modem or fiddle with all the powerline devices. This one thing done in 30 minutes has fixed all that and we are a bunch of happy gamers streamers and folks that work from home sometimes. I recommend these for anyone wanting a quick and easy setup which gets right down to using and not fiddling. Thanks Google!","positive"
"no-brainer setup set it and forget it","I can't give this enough stars.Was tired of intermittent wifi connectivity in the house.  Previous setup was to use the fios wireless router and add some inexpensive extenders in on the other floors.  This worked ok but would have coverage issues on either end of the house when the extenders were centrally located and would lose wifi connectivity periodically.  When moving around the house sometimes there would be a delay as it switched networks.Picked up a set of Google Wifi routers and never looked back.  Setup was a breeze and that it seamlessly transitions me between routers.  Wifi signal is much better throughout the house.  Love the app in that it checks on the health and speed of the system for you and makes it super easy to set up a guest network.  It also tells you all devices connected to the wifi so you can easily tell if there's a rogue device.I wish the app was merged with Google Home so I could control everything in my home in one interface but I have the same wish with Nest as well so it's just a minor inconvenience.","positive"
"Firsy Impressions","So far works like a charm.  It took 15 minutes to setup 3 nodes including updating the software. We are covering two stories and the backyard.  When setting up don't forget these broadcast a bubble - gave me many locations to choose. I will measure throughput and distances from various nodes later.","positive"
"Better than I expected!  Solved my previous home wifi issues","The Google WiFi system has exceeded my expectations.  I've always had problems in the house with my internet.  My TV would frequently freeze when streaming movies or videos.  My computer would just freeze sometimes and I had a few weak areas in the house.  I'd do speed tests and be lucky to get 16 - 20mbps when my ISP promised over 100 mb.  If I plugged my computer directly into the modem I would regularly get 115 mbps.  I also have a large outdoor deck and living area and a mother-in-law home on the property.  We had to have two internect connections to feed the entire property.  My hope was that this Mesh system would allow me to place the transmitters in the house in a shed in the back yard and then reach the apartment in the back yard.  These worked so well that I was actually able to bridge the gap to the apartment home without having a hub outside at all.  It reaches fine from a window in the back of our house to a window in the kitchen of the apartment.  This saves my mother-in-law nearly $ 80 /  month in internet costs.  That will make it pay for itself in about 4 months.  She only uses a tablet and occasionally streams a movie.  The signal to her apartment is full signal strength and the speed has only degraded to about 75mbps so it's great.  All through my house I get the full 115mbps speed and everything works great!  We do have quite a few devices on our network and no problems yet.  This was recommended to me by someone else who made the switch and I'd recommend it to anyone!","positive"
"No comparison to ISP provided AC1200 gateway and powerline adapters","What a difference this had made. I'm in a relatively small 1100sqft apartment so I assumed the XB3 provided by Comcast would be perfectly fine. This was not the case. I had to be in the same room as the gateway to even pick up the 5ghz signal and the 2.4ghz band didn't even make it in the closet. 1100sqft - seriously? The interference from so many neighbors defeated the Comcast modem. I decided to try the TP-Link AV1200 Power Line Starter Kit 3-Port Gigabit Pass-through Up to 1200Mbps(TL-PA8030P KIT) to get Ethernet into the different rooms of the apartment instead with similarly poor results. Any time the washer or dryer would run the powerline signal would drop out rendering the device useless.I decided to try the Google Wifi system because I wanted to hardwire most devices with Ethernet here's how I have it set up:Living Room: Comcast XB3 (garbage) in bridge mode -> Primary Google Wifi Circle -> Ethernet switch -> 10 devicesOffice: Secondary Google Wifi Circle -> Ethernet to 2 PCsBedroom: Secondary Google Wifi Circle -> Ethernet to Smart TVI LOVE it I have a 75/10 internet plan and consistently see the full speed on every single device connected. The Google Wifi seamlessly hands off 5ghz devices to the proper band and there's no need to have wifiNetwork-2.4 and wifiNetwork-5 broadcasting like other routers do. The ethernet ports on the secondary circles make you forget that you're technically using wireless the connection quality and ping is so consistent. The interference from all of the neighbors is no match for this device. Using a wifi analyzer app there isn't a single spot in my apartment where it can measure any degradation as compared to the Comcast modem which was degraded in the same room.The setup is very simple and I haven't had any issue with the ethernet switches. The app automatically tests your local DNS and IPv6 to determine if your modem supports them. If Google DNS benchmarks faster it will use it by default. The app has a beautiful breakdown of devices connected and data usage that destroys the Comcast xFi app. Lastly the guest work has a simple interface for passing devices through. For example you can set Chromecasts to be accessible from the Guest network but no other devices. This is great for guests who want to use the television without needing your real password which is where most guest networks fall short at.","positive"
"Speed Difference is noticeable","My existing N300 trendnet router started dropping connections after getting more smart devices connected. I tried hooking my old netgear for smart devices and that router was miserable (besides it’s irritating humming sound) and N300 sometimes used to drop connection. So decided to replace netgear one and was almost going to buy a low cost 3 star rated product (known popular vendor) however kept it on hold. Finally when it became unbearable for my wife’s laptop with usage of phone hotspot I came back to buy and came across google wifi.Long story short (actually not) bought google wifi and speed difference is noticeable (guess due to 5Ghz and 802.11ac). Anyways getting speed that I actually am buying from Comcast. So wifi routers does make a difference and investing in it is better than assuming ISP or your walls are culprit for not giving full speed.Cautions- for whatever reason google wants to collect data into their cloud for allowing advanced features. You can opt out or disable it and Wifi will still work just that it limits some of the things (I think they should be able to provide those features without storing user network info in cloud. There is a difference between using info in app and cloud just for processing vs. actually storing it. One doesn’t get to see what all info they store. Being google likely they will make the data available to the user for download like their other products).","positive"
"Works for me.  Great handoff between wifi points!!!!","I have a 2 story house and in the past I used a router and access point system connect through powerline.  The handoff between the router and access point would be flaky when walking between the 2 routers.  Plus the house still had dead wifi spots.After installing the Google wifi 3 pack.  I installed the wifi network connected to the powerline network so I don't utilize the mesh networking capabilities but I do get great wifi in all spots in the house and I don't notice any handoff issues.I hope Google doesn't kill off this product like they do with their android tv devices.But for the next 5 years plus (Until the next great wifi technology) this network should work for me.","positive"

I went through few Asus routers in the past Asus RT-N66U with Asus RP-N53 later replaced by RP-AC56 and then Asus RT-AC3200 they got the job done most of the time but things sometimes would not work had to implement automating Reboots occurring once a week just to keep things working I spent countless hours troubleshooting our WiFi changing settings etc.  and each new software update was either a blessing or a curse making things better or worse.  Finally after reading countless reviews for Google WiFi I decided it was time to make the switch and OMG I can't believe how great things are working now.  WiFi is always working every devices is connected without any issues/problems.  Most annoying thing with ASUS was that I had 3 different WiFi networks all using same credentials yet they never worked correctly some devices would not switch properly others would just refused to jump from one to another etc.  On top of it all I work from home and my work laptop is almost always on VPN which would not work properly with ASUS I could either be on LAN or WiFi but never both when connected to VPN now I am on both and everything is working as it should.  If any of this sounds familiar don't hesitate and switch to Google WiFi.","positive"

"Easy to setup - Easy to use - Great sound","I'm not techy and this was my first venture into the Smart Home world. I bought two (one for upstairs and one in the kitchen) and a 4-pack of Hue bulbs. Out of the box this thing was super easy to setup it basically did everything for me or gave clear instructions on what I needed to do. Linking the two Echos was a breeze in the app. Speaking of the app creating groups and routines in the Alexa app is very easy and fun. I haven't manually turned on a lamp since! SOUND QUALITY IS BETTER THAN I IMAGINED FROM A DEVICE THIS SIZE. The sound coming out of this little thing really is impressive!PROS:1. Easy setup.2. Easy device integration. (Alexa find my devices.) It doesn't get any easier than that.3. Responsive AI even with my mid-western draw.4. GREAT SOUND QUALITY!The only CONS I have (and these are both pretty minor):1. I can't get my Bluetooth speaker to link when the Echo speakers are playing as a group (I think this is because each Echo speaker can only be linked to either another Echo or one Bluetooth device)2. If one speaker is playing music I can't get it to switch to the group for both speakers without stopping the music and restarting with a new command. (ex. I'd like to be able to say Alexa play this song on Both Speakers. but that doesn't work; I have to say Alexa stop. then Alexa play [whatever music] on Both Speakers.)But both of those seem link minor things to me and not worth docking a star. I'd recommend this product for sure.","positive"
"Better sound great connectivity looks better and turns on the lights","I am a huge fan of the Echo. I have the tap the dot the standard Echo and an Echo smart speaker and now the plus.This one is definitely a step up. The best sound and response of all the previous models.In a nut shellThe dot is ok. Limited quality sound but small and unobtrusive. Nice for  a bedside alarm weather information and morning news while shaving.The tap is the portable and battery powered option that I use in the morning. I listen to a streaming cable news show. I listen to it while in the shower (it is not waterproof but I have a shelf far from water that it sits on) then while I shave and I put it in the closet while getting ready and dressed. It's like a portable radio but it allows me to stream internet cable and listen to anything I want.The standard Echo and Echo with smart options is a great device. The addition of the smart features is ok. It allows you to turn on lights and fixtures but going into a dark room and saying Alexa turn on lights! is not as easy as flipping a switch. It is ok for lights that are not near the bed and your heading to sleep. But you'll wake people up by shouting the wake up command.This one is good for two reasons:1.) The sound is great. Better than the others.2.) I got a smart switch and can use it to turn on any number of devices. The hook up was easy and flawless.AlsoAlexa is adding new skills. If you use a sound machine she has a sound maker for sleeping. Wake up to the weather the stock market the news a fact from history and a joke of the day.If you are on the cusp of buying this device making this your first Echo would be a great choice. If you have an Echo or tap this is a good upgrade.","positive"
"Alexa is the Queen of Smart-homes!","It's hard to say everything she does so well but the smart home hub is definitely the best par. Alexa turn on the living room lights Alexa turn the fireplace on Alexa lock the front door ...are just a few of the commands we use everyday. There is no better smart home device on the market. Period.","positive"
"Resolved Network Issues with MacBookPros at Home! Easy Setup - May Need 1 or 2 Switches for LAN","This has lived up to ALL the hype! I'm adept at managing my network however two older Linksys routers were not able to handle the many devices we have at home including constant issues faced when using MacBooks. After various unsuccessful attempts to resolve the solutions with the MBPs including setting static IPs and specifying the MTU I decided to try new network equipment.Within a matter of moments I had it installed and configured using the Wifi App on an iPhone 6. All connection issues that were previously experienced have disappeared - hallelujah! I highly recommend!SwitchesWhat happened to the old Linksys routers? I have them acting as switches. The one drawback of the Google WiFi is the loss of ethernet ports on the back. For most consumers that only use WiFi this isn't an issue but my wired gigabit network still calls for ethernet. So here is my setup:Motorola SurfBoard Cable Modem --> 1st G-WiFi Point --> 3 Switches2nd & 3rd G-Wifi Points are only extending the network","positive"
"Great product superior support.  Buy it!","Added a three pack mesh network.  Highest speed with old net gear set up was 40 MPS.  Spectrum WiFi peaked at about 50.  Google three pack runs at about105+.  Awesome.  Installation is not as easy as suggested but support spent an hour or so with as me we went from puck to puck to puck.  Is now flawless and screaming fast. Streams video on three devices at a time without a hiccup.  Highly recomended.  I am only sort of a techie and this was pretty easy.  Ran into some issues later on.  Google tech support was incredibly patient and worked with me until resolved. DO NOT keep a router/modem with integral WiFi with the WiFi on.  The pucks kept taking its IP address.  Once the old WiFi was turned off and the modem set to bridge mode everything worked great. Stable and fast.","positive"
"Simply Works","Our home's 3 stories. The last 5 years we've had two 2nd generation Asus 'ac' wifi routers one the primary on the first floor the other a wired access point on the second floor. That setup worked pretty well but there were dead spots and the primary router has been flaky since a recent power outage sometimes losing it's 'mind'. Within an hour of the Google Wifi system's delivery I had removed the old hardware and setup the Google system. There's no dead spots anywhere and the signal on the third floor is near perfect. There's one thing to be aware of. Many older routers are configured with the ip address 192.168.1.1.  The Google system's base router ip address is 192.168.86.1. if anyone's configured any of their wireless devices like a wifi printer with a fixed ip address for example 192.168.1.100 change it to 192.168.86.xxx before you  connect it to the Google system.","positive"
"Fixed every Apple Airport Extreme and Express signal issue 100%","I replaced an Apple Airport Extreme with two Airport Express' with this new Google Wifi.  We have a 3000sqft house and had signal issues in several rooms.  Mostly the issues I had were bandwidth related.  I have Comcast Internet with 55Mbps down.  I could test at 54Mbps down in the main room with the Extreme but both Express' would test at 3-5Mbps.  Google Wifi it can test throughput between each device.  One satellite is testing at 140Mbps to the main unit and the other at about 80Mbps.  Both satellite locations can test the full 55Mbps on an external speed test.Also when just looking at signal bars on your iphone I have full strength in every room in my house plus the main front yard and backyard.  We have over two acres and I have medium strength out across part of our property in my shop.We have an average of 30 devices connected at a time including streaming video products like Roku.  We also have wifi cameras all around our property.  On the Apple system the wifi cameras hogged about 40% of the available bandwidth.  Now I don't even notice them.Best wifi upgrade I've ever done.","positive"
"This is the best router I have ever owned and I highly recommend you get a set.","I've had this set of mesh routers for about a month now and I have had zero issues with it. Setup is done all in the app downloaded onto a smartphone or tablet making it one of the easier setups. If your looking for true plug and play this is the router for you. I went from a Linksys ea6900 router and it is a remarkable improvement in stability. With my old router I was having to reboot it at least once a week to reconnect everything to the internet. With the google routers I haven't had to do that a single time yet. So stability is a definite improvement. You can monitor your network with the app on your smartphone or tablet as an added bonus. You can restart the network dim the lights on the routers even setup port forwarding and static IPs should you feel the need.  The coverage are for three routers is about right. I have around 2100 sq feet split between upstairs and downstairs and positioned the routers around the house. On one side of the house I put the main router right against the wall on the far side of the house due to where the internet enters my home. The second one is in a bedroom about 65 feet away through one wall and the last is downstairs right below the main router. I have seen a substantial improvement in not only WIFI  coverage but speed as well. I pay for 100MBs and was only getting around half that in the first bedroom and spotty coverage at best in the far end of the house. downstairs in the basement was spotty at best and it was right below the main router I had before. Now I have tested the internet speed throughout my home and have seen we consistently get our full download speed within about 10MBs.  Parental controls are included in the settings of the app as well. All you need to do is setup each device and give it a name like kids or whatever. From that point on you can set a schedule to turn off the internet during set times. You can also pause the internet whenever needed from the app for homework time or whatever you need it for(punishment). I would most certainly recommend this mesh router for anyone needing the coverage even as just a single router.","positive"
"I LOVE the design and ease of set up","I have had issues with my wireless connections in a three story house for some time now.  I am not tech savvy on how to troubleshoot this so I did my research on a new router to help solve this.  I am working from home a lot more and HAVE to have reliable connections for my long workday.  I saw this Google Wifi System came in on the top ten 2017 list from PC review expert sites so I thought it would be a great place to start.  I did message the Amazon contact site to ensure that if for some reason this did not work for me can it be returned or credited to me.  I was assured that yes a return is honored if this does not work for my situation.  It was a bit pricey but I like what I saw and had to give this a try.It arrived earlier than expected (THANK YOU Amazon) and I was excited to set it up.  First of all the system is modern small and a great design.  The Google Wifi app makes installation a breeze.  I LOVE the app.  You can assess the speed of everything and monitor connectivity often.  You can see what devices are connected and to what extender.  I got the system with three so I could put an extender on each floor.  I had it set up and running flawlessly in less than 30 minutes and so far so good.  I love that you can prioritize a work computer or device for an allotted amount of time to maximize speed and efficiency.  I will be trialing this for my work duties this week and I think from what I have seen and assessed so far my problem may be solved. Thank you Google and Amazon.","positive"
"Undocumented Product Update.  All three access points now have WAN/LAN connections.","It appears the delays in shipping from Google might have been to reconfigure the WiFi system.  The set of three access points that arrived yesterday after nearly a month of waiting were identical units all with WAN and LAN ports!Devices connected to satellite routers via the LAN or WAN port identify their network connection as ethernet and access the internet.  For those that are co-locating their Google Wifi adjacent to entertainment centers this makes for a welcome surprise and justifies the patience of waiting for Google to fill the supply chain. Now they can be attached to the Google routers with a switch and further reduce WiFi congestion.  Set up of the network is unchanged and requires less than fifteen minutes.  The Google Wifi App remains intuitive and requires no addition settings for the additional LAN equipped routers.The packaging now states: 2 Gigabit Ethernet ports per point. Ports can be configured as WAN or LAN. This new configuration addresses many of the early criticisms of the system and makes it the price performance leader.","positive"
"Awsome Product","It just works and works great! The easiest WiFi setup ever. If you like to tinker with your set up this may not be for you. But if you're like me and have better things to do with your time Google WiFi is the way to go. Very quick & easy setup. From opening the box to having the access points placed and the network up and running was about 30 minutes most of that time was thinking about where to put the access points. Overall speeds have increased especially our WiFi. Love the smartphone app it's easy and intuitive. Based on two days experience so far I highly recommend Google WiFi.Update: still VERY happy with google wifi. Had some problems with the kids getting into trouble and it was a piece of cake to selectively turn on or off wifi. Great product!","positive"
"Works Great and Easy Setup on Verizon Fios","We have had this in place two weeks now and it has worked flawlessly.  Only regret is that I didn't purchase this when it first came out.We have about 4300 sf over three floors including a finished basement.  Prior to Google Wifi I had a Verizon Fios 802.11n router in the lower level a Linksys 802.11n router on the main level and a network extender on the upper level...all in order to try to get coverage throughout.  It did not work well as we had locations with poor coverage and our mobile devices (including laptops) were often connected to the wrong wifi with the weakest signal.  Download speeds were often slow or we would lose connection altogether for a period of time.I turned off wireless on the Fios Router and removed the Linksys router and network extender from the equation.  The main (hardwired) Google router is on the main level with one each centrally located on the floors above and below.  Coverage is great everywhere and speeds are lightening fast (over 80Mgbs both download and upload).  And we no longer have trouble printing to one of our two wireless printers as everything is now on the same network at all times.Set-up was very easy with the app.  It was so easy that it seemed I had missed a step but I hadn't.  Not many controls but I want a network I can set-up and forget...which is exactly what we got.Great product!","positive"
"Perfect solution for elininating dead zones and dropped wifi signals","This system worked perfectly.  I previously had a pretty strong wifi router with an extender on the lower floor.  I still had dead zones in the house and my phone battery would die endlessly searching for a signal.  The wifi in the house was very unstable and our equipment would drop off and on the signal.  So I setup three of these - two on the upper floor and one on the bottom floor.  We now have excellent and stable coverage all over the house.  The downstairs bedroom used to be a total dead zone - now wifi in there is very fast with very stable signals even when streaming music or videos on the laptop.  No more endlessly searching for signals - all of our devices work at the same time with no apparent loss of coverage.  I am so happy I decided to switch out our router system.  We didn't change the modem or internet service - just the way it was delivered throughout our house.  Especially for a two story house this solved all of our issues!","positive"
"Why did it take so long Google for you guys to come out with this!","WOW! Really WOW! The performance of these things blew me away. We had a Motorola modem+router setup (Arris Surfboard) and were having horrible wifi dropping issues. Installed these and not only do we now have great wifi throughout the house (3 level house with full basement) the dropping issues have completely gone away as well! Was having terrible FireTV stick wifi drop issues that have disappeared as well. Getting 175 mbps download! Never had seen that number before on a speediest in my house prior to this!!!I'm really happy I bought these as opposed to Netgear Orbi based on the prior reviews. Trying to return the favor forward.Buy these and you won't be disappointed.","positive"
"Google Wifi has saved my sanity!","I have what my ISP claims is their top router but over the last month since starting to upgrade to a smarter home I have been having problems with connections droppings. ISP says there really isn't much they can do about it unless I upgrade to a MUCH more expensive plan. I got real tired of resetting the router every few hours and remembered hearing about Google Wifi somewhere so decided to give it a try one day shipping why not!Setup was so simple my 8 year old could have done it. Got all my devices connected (around 30 of em) quickly and absolutely zero problems with dropped connections. I originally thought I may need at least 2 to cover my 2 story house (which is within the range for coverage for one unit) but it seems to be going strong with the one! I'll likely grab another soon though to extend a bit into the yard.App is a bit on the basic side but that is a good thing for most users. I would have liked to see an additional web interface but not going to cry about it. I love that you can see network traffic live and give devices priority (though it's unfortunate you can't remember the priority forever.) IP reservation and port forwarding is simple as well.I also really love how the 2.4 and 5ghz connections remain under the same SSID. Makes networking so much simpler. Had to hook up a switch for my wired PC's but no biggie there.Much love to Google for this amazing product :)","positive"
"Solved our network problems. Could not be any more pleased!","Finally! We have been struggling with wifi slow or dead zones in our house for years. From cheap to expensive routers to moving router locations to setting custom devices on specific channels ect...none of the common solutions really worked for us in our older home. A month or so ago someone recommended we look at the 3 pc Google Wifi system and set up a mesh network. Honestly I have not ever had an easier setup experience. The app walks you right through the setup process and you can do incredible things on that app. This system has completely changed our wifi experience in the house! I have not stopped raving about this system since I installed it. The guest wifi has been wonderful. So has the ability to use the app features to analyze network speed and activity pause the wifi for unplugging and many more things I could praise. Get it if you are on the fence. We could not be more pleased with having seamless full-speed network activity anywhere in the house or on our property.","positive"
"The most graceful home wifi solution on the market.","We've been struggling with wifi in our single family home for almost two years now using the cheap router provided by the ISP. Even just 30-50ft away from the router we'd have issues with low signal strength buffering and drops. We pay for 150Mbps and get just that with a wired connection but would only get 20-40Mbps via wifi even when standing directly next to the router.I debated purchasing a better single router but the new mesh technology seemed like a good way to put our wifi woes to rest permanently. Even though it may be a bit of overkill for our sub-2000sf home I purchased the three router pack to ensure we could get full coverage in our backyard and second floor.My first reaction: WOW! We're getting full signal throughout the house and backyard now but more importantly we're getting almost the entire 150Mbps via wifi now. Multiple devices streaming at once on wifi are no problem. I notice no speed drops as it hands off between access points. Just consistently fast coverage everywhere. I didn't realize just how used to slower wifi speeds I'd become until I started using this system.Additionally and I know it's subjective but the devices are very attractive and match the current understated design philosophy of so many newer consumer electronics. Unlike many other routers out there whose design screams EXTREME SPEED! these are meant to look at home in your decor. No need to cram them in the utility closet. They also feel very sturdy and well made. The comparisons to white hockey pucks are apt.It's already been stated many times but the setup is as effortless as advertised. I'm confident that even the least computer savvy users could have these up and running in minutes using the very well designed app.I would recommend these to anyone struggling with home wifi coverage or network slowness. The difference is amazing and the cost compared to comparable systems is fantastic. I'm very pleased with the purchase!","positive"
"Works great with Verizon Fios","I bought these to extend the wifi range of our condo. It's not a big condo but our Verizon Gateway router is on one end of the condo and the bedrooms are on the other. Using the internet in the bedrooms was a pain in the butt until I installed these around the house! To install these you will need to first go in to the router page and turn off the wireless signal coming from the router itself then just follow the prompt from Google Wifi app on your phone. Installation was effortless. Now we have fast internet everywhere in the house! This is a cheap alternative to the wifi extender from Verizon.","positive"
"in a 5 bedroom suburban home I can monitor all three networks easily from my phone","Google wifi.I have 3 Google wifi networks in 3 locations.network #1 – 5 nodes (4 wired 1 wireless coverage over 2 rural acres. one of the wired nodes is powered via POE to USB-C)network #2 – 2 nodes wired in a 1 bedroom apartment with extremely crowded wifi bandwidth (30+ 2.4ghz networks 20~ 5ghz) (4 nestoutdoor cams)#3 – 3 nodes all wireless in a 5 bedroom suburban homeI can monitor all three networks easily from my phone monitoring daily weekly monthly usage of each device. I can pause any device on any network or prioritize a device (say when I want uninterrupted hi-def video from a particular camera)I can reset any network as a whole or any one node. I can see every device that connected and trigger events to occur in any hone using IFTTT (turn on lights when elderly mother’s phone connects at 3a). I can not just talk my sister 4 states away through the process of pausing her kids Xbox & Tablets for bedtime or dinner – I can just do it for her real time. program one bedtime to pause all the 9 year olds devices and another later bedtime one for the teenagers phone and game console.I can do all this in seconds with an intuitive easy to use interface.I can perform bandwidth tests on the whole network and on every node telling me where my backhaul needs tweaking.Because Google wifi data is integrated with Google maps I can generate precise location and mapping data – because for example my rural network has 5 nodes all which are tracked in Google maps allowing precision location acquisition at any point on the property.In short no other system is this intuitive this flexible this “smart”.There’s no comparison – Google Wifi is a winner. It does things other mesh systems other networks simply can’t do.Otherwise systems may outperform marginally in a particular environment type (suburban home with limited interference) but in the REAL WORLD people are living in crowded wifi spectrum environments - Google Wifi wins in this environment.Only Google wifi has the device network switching and channel selection algorithms to push performance to the max in ANY environment.The level of smart home integration with Google Sheets data logging IFTTT Nest and many other products - means no other product can even be compared to Google wifi because nothing else can do what it does.And with monthly automatic firmware updates from Google - you're fully future-proofed.Best of all - the darn things look good.","positive"
"This is truly an improvement in router technology. I ...","This is truly an improvement in router technology.  I previously used an Apple Extreme and 3 extenders to get 4 bar reception but my download speed was typically around 75MbPS.  With just 3 of these my speed has increased to typically over 175 MBPS.  Also I have as many as 25 devices connected to my wifi (smart home) and previously would have devices going off line but now with the mesh wifi all the devices stay connected all the time.","positive"
"So far so good!","I was hesitant to spend the money on a whole home WiFi system thinking I could manage it more cheaply. But after spending money on WiFi extenders that turned out to be useless I decided I’d be spending less in the long run if this solution worked. I have about 3000 square feet to cover between my two main floors and a finished basement. And this system did the job! It was super easy to set up. It does require a google login but I already had that. The actual setup took literally minutes and I was up and running with zero issues. The app is easy to use and gives you great info about which devices are in use. You can even pause your kids’ WiFi use if you need to get them off. So far this is working great and I have full signal strength in every corner of my home now.","positive"
"Better than any other home wireless I have used","Do you want good wireless that you don't want to think about? Chuck your regular router and replace it with these. I've set up my parents and my house with these and they have been faultless. Coverage is now excellent performance is better than ever and the app is great. Before going to these I had a series of D-Link and Netgear devices that were at best okay. I also compared it against the Orbi. Once I tried the Google Wifi the Orbi went straight back to the store. The Orbi felt like a regular router with an app grafted on. The Google Wifi feels like a complete designed system. The only thing better is a full Ubiquiti setup or some other enterprise hardware and nobody has time for that with their home wireless.","positive"
"Solves SO many problems","Holy Toldeo! I'd give this 6 stars if I could. I've had many different routers ofver the last 20 years and this is the best one by far for ease of use and for coverage.1. Every other router I've ever had has had an intimidating and opaque user interface If you need to configure something about these others you have to wade through multiple menus of features you car barely understand.  Google WiFi by contrast manages alsmot all of those features for you - not showing you the things you wouldn't know what to do with anyway. I can't imagine that there is more than one user in a thousand who would need the pre-configured features.2. The two techie features it leaves available are IP reservation and port forwarding.  In 25 years of internet software development these are the only special features I've ever really needed to manage.  GWF lets mew name my devices with names I can remember and doesn't even LET me worry about such things as MAC addresses - which  it manages for me.3. Setup was absolutely intuitive.  I got the three pack and had the whole bunch set up and functioning in less than half an hour..  Our condo is 2500 square feet on one floor and I got eexceelent coverage not only everywhere in the condo but also in the common basemanet which is two floors further down.4. I use Chromecast audio for remote speakerss around the house..  Prior routers would lose connection with these frequently and for no apparent reason. GWF hasn't lost one yet. (It probably helps that Google would consider it important to maintain conncetions among their devices!)5. I've also got a couple of Google Home Minis. And their connection to GWF was also intuitive.In short (well okay: in long) I have found nothing negative and everyhting positive about GWF for my uses in my enivronment.","positive"
"Google WiFi: Go for it.","From set-up to sign-on this mesh system is simply incredible.  It took me all of maybe 20 minutes total to set it up and have it operational.  I purchased a three-unit system for WiFi in a modest sized 3 bedroom home that includes an in-law apartment over the garage.  I set the master unit in the center of the house and put one unit in the in-law apartment and one unit on the other side of the house.  There's not a single spot in the house where we can't pick up WiFi including the basement the garage driveway and back patio.I've seen reviews where people complain that you have to have internet service before you can set up the product.  Truthfully I'm not sure why that is a complaint...seems that the reason to purchase this product is to set up WiFi access to your internet service.  I purchased the Google system to replace an outdated WiFi router already in the house.  After reading a lot of reviews on different units I decided to go the extra dollars for the mesh system.  Although I like the technical back-end setting up a router I chose the simpler Google system set-up over that because I'm the only geek in the house anyway.  What most people really want in a wireless set-up is to be able to sign on and just use their device with a strong reliable signal.Setup involves connecting one unit to your ISP modem (ethernet cable provided) and opening the phone app which will seek the unit using bluetooth.  Once the unit is located and acquired the app prompts you to install the next unit if you are installing more than one.  Continue this way until all units are installed and acquired.  That's it.  Nothing more to it.Google WiFi mesh totally rocks it for signal strength and what so far has proven to be rock-solid reliability.  Simple set up simple sign-on simple use of a phone app to manage the system (which by the way I can access even if my ISP drops out).  The app allows set-up of a guest network as well (which is nice for visitors who need internet access occasionally but that you don't necessarily want having access to your home network).At last count mine is a household with 17 devices between smart TVs smart phones PCs and Macs wireless printers and other electronic devices.  There's plenty of signal strength for all of it.","positive"
"Much better wifi network than what I had before.","Pros: I now have 5 bars everywhere in the house. My speedtest.net results on my laptop went from 50Mb/s to 160Mb/s when I switched to this from a 1200a/c router.Cons: You can't set the network address for you home network. Mine went from 198.162.0.xxx to 192.168.86.xxx. You'll be amazed at how many of your tablets tivos and printers cannot make the transition gracefully. Also there are two ethernet ports on the bottom. One for the wired network and one for the isp modem. They never tell you which is which. The circular one is for the modem.","positive"
"Fantastic Product to extend your home WiFi signal Painlessly","I was using an Apple Airport Extreme in the center of my house and never could get reliable internet coverage throughout the entire house. I was thinking about buying a second Airport Extreme to extend my network when someone suggested that I give the Google WiFi Mesh system a try. Wow what a difference. I downloaded the Google WiFi App on my phone connected the  unit to my modem (any of the three can be used to connect to your modem) and the app walked me through set up and placing the other two units. The system next performed an update which took about ten minutes and I was up and running with excellent WiFi coverage in my house and detached office in my back yard. The whole process took less than fifteen minutes and I love being able to control internet to individual devices connected to my network. Superb system and I highly recommend it.","positive"
"Heavens gift to technology!","Let me start by saying I FINALLY bought the Goggle Wifi after months of my husbands constant nagging nagging about how Internet sucks and the ominous glares that can end all glares. We had the DLink Sys for 9 years and our own modem. Just last year it started acting weird and crazy. Our internet connection becoming slow with plenty of interruptions causing us to reboot the modem and router several times a day. Add to that movie streaming became a nightmare. I called the internet provider twice told us everything is working fine. They checked the line the post the works. The problem persisted so I called the router company for a firmware upgrade which ended up useless too. After much needled research I came upon this product and gave it a GO. And let me tell you it is AMAZING! It takes only 5-10 minutes to set up. If you have an existing Goggle account much better. Customizable settings right at your fingertips. I have a 100mbps speed. Before I set up the Goggle wifi I was running at 42 download and 11 upload. Ridiculous right? Now that the device is set up I'm running at more than 100mbps. Continuous movie streaming has never felt so satisfying! I have a 1500 sq ft house so 1 device is enough. Super fast speed sleek and modern design and most of all you can add access points anytime you want. I am truly impressed! Thank God for this...now I can rest from all the nagging and glares...","positive"
"I was persistently plagued with slow speed and poor signal. I spent a significant amount of time ...","Prior to buying this router I was unable to get a consistent wifi signal throughout my house I was persistently plagued with slow speed and poor signal. I spent a significant amount of time researching mesh wifi routers and decided to go with the google wifi. I have a 4500sq ft house and have the primary router set up in a corner in my basement with mesh points #2 and #3 set up across the rest of the house. I consistently have excellent wifi signal strength with full speed. I am able to have multiple devices streaming 4K video at the furthest mesh point.Set up is very easy (I am a novice) and the device updates its self to maintain a high level of security. You can also pause select devices on the net work - if you have kids you can temporarily cut their internet access :-).If you have problems with poor signal strength or consistency of signal throughout your home this is the system you want to get. Its defiantly more expensive then other systems on the market but it is well worth the price. Overall I am very happy with this system.","positive"
"Thrilled with the performance the aesthetics and ease.","I am SO happy with these! It was super easy to set up. Mine aren't visible because of where we need them but I wouldn't mind if they were.  They look sleek and have a small footprint. Our home/property is long and narrow and our cable internet connection is in the front of the house.  Our house is only 1100 sq.ft. but we couldn't get internet coverage in the back of the house & property. Wireless extenders were a joke. There are multiple walls the signal needs to pass through (including a brick chimney) and nothing worked. We now have the main router where the internet comes in.  The second is about 30 ft. (and 2 walls) away.  The last one is only 10 ft. (& one wall) away on our back service porch.  We have excellent coverage in the back including inside our detached garage. (It even reaches across the street in my neighbor's house.)  No it wasn't cheap but it was so worth the money. Almost 4 months later and we've had no issues at all. My sister works at Google and her price for this was the same as here.","positive"
"so far I LOVE this system","so far I LOVE this system fast strong even blanketed wifi through my entire home with 3 nodes easy setup great maintenance app and they look cool taboot. One specific benefit I'll highlight beyond just the usual network speed and penetration improvements you already know about: my internet for things devices (smart bulbs and plugs and etc) are all working MUCH more reliably than they were on my traditional router I used to have to manually reset them several times a week to keep them functioning smoothly and now I literally have not had to once since switching to google wifi.Highly recommended all the way around wonderful solution and I have no complaints whatsoever.One thing: if you have several hardwired items (I have a tv pc and steamlink all running off ethernet) you'll need to buy a simple and cheap ethernet switch (mine was like 20 bucks).","positive"
"Google Wifi is amazing","Amazing! I have always had trouble with dead spots and router failures and incomprehensible installation instructions but not with Google Wi-Fi. It installs in minutes using your cell phone or tablet updates the software and then tests the quality of the setup.I am on Spectrum with 100Mbps service. Using their modem/router I could never get more than 50 Mbps very close to the router but much less at a little distance. My  desktop computer and printer are located upstairs and at a distance. WiFi barely worked and power line Ethernet adapters were slow and burned out regularly. Google WiFi now gives me 110Mbps almost everywhere and no less than 75Mbps in a few bad spots! I thought maybe the app was fudging the numbers so I double checked using the Speedtest app and got the same numbers.Besides working good the units look good so you don't have to hide them.","positive"
"What a difference this makes!!!","Made an unbelievable difference! My house is about 2100 sq/ft on the main floor and about 1900 sq/ in the basement. With my router/modem from Spectrum I could barely stream Netflix in my basement sometimes it would just buffer. Since I was paying for high speed internet from Spectrum I was frustrated to say the least. Tried an extender waster of money did nothing. Then a friend told me aboutGoogle WiFi and I thought at this point I have nothing to lose except for someone to install it for me after reading the reviews online about how easy it was to set up I decided to try it on my own. Since I had the modem/router combination unit I had to call Spectrum and instruct them to turn off the wireless portion on the modem that was the hardest part of the whole install everything else was super easy. Trust meyou can do it. Before the install I was getting about 45 mbps sitting right next to my old router and in the basement I was getting form 6-12 mbps not good. Now I am getting 117 mpbs pretty much all through my house! Couldn't be happier with this product.","positive"
"Works great! We have 2300 sq ft home w two ...","Works great ! We have 2300 sq ft home w two floors. The modem/ router supplied by ISP was not cutting it... we could not FaceTime or stream in any other room besides the one with the modem over wifi. We can do those things in every room in the house now. We tried a network extending plug in thing before this and the google wifi works much better. We don't have to constantly re establish the wifi connectivity like we used to with the network extender. Love the connectivity with our Hue lights bridge. Like the option to turn off wifi for family time though haven't tried it yet. Can't say enough good things!","positive"
"Great Mesh System For Any Home","I have nothing negative to say about Google Wifi as it has worked flawlessly for the first month we've had it. The system is replacing a modem/router provided by our ISP (simply put it in bridge mode so it only acts as a modem) and a repeater we had in a bedroom that never worked that well. We have a two level house so getting a signal downstairs was always very painful with the old system. Now with this mesh system getting a signal almost anywhere on the property (including in the back yard) is no problem anymore. The best part about it is that the speed is top-notch everywhere! It's not one of those systems where the further you are from the main router the slower things get. We consistently get 120/20 everywhere in the house which is great! Now just wish Google Fiber would get to our neighborhood so I can drop my current ISP/Cable company like a bad habit.","positive"
"Easier set up than a stand alone router.","I started looking for an upgrade to technology when I was forced to upgrade our level of internet service. I hadn't seen the wifi mesh option and was a little skeptical. There were concerns about set up managing multiple devices signal strength etc. I settled on the Google Wifi based on both cost (similar options were more expensive) and the wide array of options available in the day to day management of the system. Set up was a breeze. By breeze I refer to 3 wifi nodes in 3 rooms with the process managed by an app on my phone in less than 15 minutes. The result was an increase in download speed by 50mbps with a strong signal throughout the house. We stream everything in the house and the speed and clarity of streaming videos or live tv was shockingly faster with absolutely no hiccups or buffering.","positive"
"So easy to set up.  Regular  security updates.","I am sorry that I didn't order this sooner!  I have needed a new router as mine was quite old  but I was concerned about how difficult it would be to set up.  (I remember the tech from Radio Shack setting up my original WiFi router years ago... a bit of a nightmare!)Setting up this router is easier than making scrambled eggs and toast!  Seriously... less than ten minutes from start to finish.  The Google WiFi app does all of the work for you.The WiFi is strong throughout my two bedroom area with just one unit.If you are nervous about setting up a WiFi router  this one is worth your time!","positive"
"BY FAR THE BEST WI-FI OPTION OUT THERE!!","Absolutely LOVE this WiFi system!  It is by far the best I've ever used.  We installed a Ring floodlight which is at the about 50 feet from the first router then set one in the bedroom nearest the floodlight and one in the lower level garage.  We probably did a bit of overkill using all three but we wanted to ensure strong consistent connectivity.  It is absolutely amazing!!  Best I have ever used by far.  These three units network as one so no more searching for a WiFi repeater no more low signals!  You are able to check the status of your network on your smartphone remotely test your speed strength and many other options.  Look no further for a WiFi solution for your home.  This is the ONLY one to purchase.","positive"
"The Quantum router they provide performs very good when using the wired cat 5/6 connection","I have Verizon fios gigabit internet as my service provider. The Quantum router they provide performs  very good when using the wired cat 5/6 LAN  connection. However the Quantum router's wifi connection isn't very good at all. Unless you are in the same room with the router the speed and range of the router is less than mediocre. I stream a lot of movies TV shows and YouTube videos but I can only watch them in the living room (where Verizon's Quantum router is located) if I am to watch without buffering and/or loss of signal to devices located elsewhere in the house. I did a lot of research on my options as to weather I should get Verizon's Quantum network extender or a second router to put in the opposite side of the house where there is little to no signal. I came across these Google WiFi mesh routers. I probably read all of the customer reviews on these routers and for the most part I was very impressed with the customer reviews. I paid a little more than I wanted to ($250 +) to improve the wireless network network in my home. However if I was to put more money in my wifi network then I wanted it to meet my expectations on how a wireless network should operate and that is to have a strong fast and dependable network signal  in every corner in my home. That is exactly what these Google WiFi routers gave me. To be honest one of these wifi routers would have meet my expectations but the two additional mesh routers gives me a strong connection almost covering my entire cul-de-sac. This means I can stream music from my wifi network instead of my mobile network when listening to music while grilling in my backyard or cleaning/detaling my vehicles in my driveway. I would never have been able to do these things before purchasing the Google WiFi mesh routers. Ultimately if you are looking to enhance and extend your Wi-Fi network then from my experience these are the routers that will that and more. I highly recommend this Google mesh Wi-Fi network.","positive"

"200 MBbps up and down and handles it fine.","I'm pretty happy with the bundle of Google Wifi.  The only issues that I have had with it is when the power failed it didn't come back and link back up on its own.  Other than that it has been great.  I have Utopia fiber and have 200 MB/sec service.  This handles those speeds wirelessly pretty well.  I have 100+ MB/sec upload and download speeds every day.  Most days I have about 180 - 190 MB both up and down wirelessly while having 10-12 devices on it.","positive"
"My Wi-Fi SUCKED!!","My Wi-Fi SUCKED!!!! For several years *not mentioning the amount of time since I never did much figure it out* I am not an IT person and I did purchase a Motorolla Panoramic Modem/Router that did 0 for an undisclosed amount.. Bumped up service with ISP to NO avail.... I have a 2k sq ft home with CAT 6 running everywhere for cameras 2 story etc. etc. I have had horrible Wi-Fi forever.. Spouse and I had countless arguments over reasoning so I did it! I decided to try it. (What's another $300 right?) BAM! Not only can I reduce the speed buy my Amazon TV doesn't buffer any more at a high download speed... WOW I cannot say enough of how great it feels to be Right when I argued this purchase and now I can watch whatever I want on my Amazon. I have cancelled my Cable TV and run antenna with Amazon and Netflix and I have not looked back since!!!! Now although I bought the 3 pack I gave the last one to my parents.. They are thrilled too.. Great Decision and so Happy I made this purchase. The set up was so easy someone like myself installed it in less than 20 minutes.. I absolutely would recommend this to anyone having issues!!","positive"
"Kudos to Google for a GREAT PRODUCT and execution thereof!","I bought a Linksys Velop system back in March 2017 and had a miserable time with setup. Got Linksys to help and after a whole host of undocumented procedures finally got the thing to function. Even so we have been plagued with intermittent drop-outs and node restarts. This last weekend the node lost contact with the main node and it would not reconnect. Even bringing it within a foot of the main node failed. That was the last straw.I bought the Google Wifi and had it set up and working within 20 minutes and it works great! Seamless and informative walk-thru and like I said worked the first time with not ONE hiccup. PERFECT. The hardest part was unpacking it from the very professional and way too nice looking packaging.The definition of a no-brainer.The signal is MUCH stronger than Velop ever was.I am VERY pleased with this Google Wifi.My Velop is going to Goodwill.Kudos to Google for a GREAT PRODUCT and execution thereof!","positive"
"I'm so Googlied eyed 0_0","I just got it to setup and I will give a quick reminder to anyone about to setup this router is to download google wifi in the App Store before you start. So let me say I am sold on this router it's easy to setup and it only takes minutes. The signal strength is very impressive at least for me because I wouldn't be able to get signal from one end to the other end of the house but now I get a very stable 2-3(full) bars end to end beyond 2 walls so i'm very satisfied by the range. So now about speed from close range I hit my max speed of 70mbs download 15mbs upload. I can't compare since I was using a crap router that limited my speed all these times full of regrets getting a decent modem but a crap router. Save yourself the stress and fork over the extra dough you won't be disappointed.","positive"
"Nearly Instant WiFi Deployment For Your House","These are now widely dispersed across This Old House with great performance -- two at different ends of the house on the second floor and one in the attic which covers the attic office and the master bedroom which is the room under the hub. Setup is via a Google app that you download from the App Store but you only get the link for the app after you buy the system. Each hub is controlled via a Bluetooth Link which adds a physical layer of security if you're worried about a Russian hacker reprogramming your hub via the Internet. Bluetooth itself is a short-range standard with a range of only about 36 ft (12m) or so which means you have to be in or near the premises in order to access the hubs to reprogram them.One hub does need to plug into your cable modem in order to connect with the outside world. The other two can be placed anywhere you want as long as you have AC mains available. They're small and light and can be placed almost anywhere. I have two on bookcases and one discretely placed on a window sill. I recommend reading the instructions a couple of times before setup to avoid any difficulties.","positive"
"Great mesh system","System worked perfectly.  I don't have the largest house in the world but it is a bit of a rambling ranch and I also wanted to make sure I had good coverage in the yard around the house.  This system has been much better than any I've had in the past.  I've done lots of things in the past hardwired APs wireless repeaters wireless bridges and this has all of them beat.  Much easier to setup and the interface is quite good.  Still a couple of things that could be located better in the interface but being able to test your speed from ISP between mesh points and to your device at a specific point are pretty nice.  It's also nice to be able to name your devices and set priorities through the interface.I read a lot of reviews for wireless mesh systems before purchasing this and for the average consumer I think this really hits the nail on the head.","positive"
"Great set of devices. Does the job well .","I am an old IT guy. Been setting up home wireless networks since they first started selling them for residential use. Back when it took an IT guy to do it. it was hard to setup my XBox than it was this. I swear I could train a cat to do it. Great mesh network solution for home use good network speed. I have 3 units in a 2400 Sq ft wooden frame house and we have solid connections anywhere. Parental controls are decent.The app is really easy to use and gives pretty good functionality. The one weird thing about the parental controls I noticed when the schedule shuts off the internet access for the kids devices at that moment it appears to make a really strange whining noise and usually frequently yells STUPID GOOGLE WIFI!!!!. lol.","positive"
"Just switched from  Luma to Google Wifi and happy I did!","We have WIFI! WOOT. I had opted into Luma in hopes that the little start up powered by Amazon would have the right combination of security and availability for me and my home. I really enjoyed the Luma setup but I kept dropping signal. It was a catch 22. One too many Luma and the mesh network starts hopping from one access point to the other and your network slows down your iOT start to misbehave and you don't know if you need more devices or less. I did that for six months and finally decided to try Google Wifi.So happy I did! I placed the three Google Wifi mesh access points in the same spots where I had previously placed the Luma and now I have coverage throughout the entire home! These things are much more powerful as far as range and connectivity is concerned. Subsequently my speedtests went from 80 down / 60 up with Luma to 90 down / 90 up with Google Wifi.I also spent some time asking the Luma team about Transport Layer Security (TLS) and when it would come to their platform. Since they couldn't give me a date and Google Wifi has it now it made sense for me to switch. It really came down to this: Google is a powerhouse where it comes to resources by comparison to nearly any other Router provider. They have antivirus and antimalware teams ensuring that the routers are not hacked (Asus and Netgear anyone?) They are in the business of ensuring that we are online 24x7 and to that end Google Wifi delivers.If you are concerned about Privacy and you should be. Consider that the Google Wifi uses its own DNS servers instead of your ISP's but you can alternatively use your ISP's DNS if you prefer or any other (I recommend OpenDNS dot org) But having your traffic encrypted between your home and Google's DNS servers is a good start by way of TLS.If you have privacy needs you may want to consider a VPN service they can be had very reasonably these days.The App is definitely basic you have all the necessary controls to get up and running and check network health and perform some basic troubleshooting. Advanced networking geeks like me will pine for finer granularity and control of the network. Things like print servers and USB connections and Samba all missing from present day configuration will make us think twice about opting into Google Wifi.So why did I do it? Because I'd like to just have excellent wifi throughout the house and go do something else this weekend besides toy with my network settings. Google consistently topped reviews throughout the web and I give up trying to fight my googly overlords.","positive"
"Don't want to run cables? No problem!","After my Airport Extreme gave up the ghost I was in need of a new wireless network. So I bit the bullet and got the 3 pack Google WiFi.There was one hiccup with setting this up: the devices wouldn't respond to the app at first. After talking to the very very helpful customer service representative (perhaps this is where the Google Wallet support staff ended up?) I learned that I probably have a returned Google WiFi set in my possession and all I had to do was factory reset the devices.Once that was done there were zero issues. The app works a treat keeps tabs on everything connected to the WiFi and makes access management a breeze. Sure I wouldn't use it in an enterprise setting but this Just Works way better than the old Airport ever did. I've used network extenders before and they were a royal pain in the butt. While pricier these will deliver WiFi to where you need it unless your building is a Faraday cage.Well ok one problem did happen: I lost access to the wired local area network attached to the router and the printer that was attached to it (the WiFi can't access other devices on the upstream router in mesh mode). That was solved by attaching an Ethernet switch to the LAN port of one of the devices.","positive"
"Definitely an improvement!","We bought these a couple of months ago and I wanted to see just how well they performed before posting a review. Anyway I’m very happy we purchased these. Prior to this our WiFi would drop off completely if we were more than 50+ feet away from the router. Our home is approximately 1800 sq ft with lath and plaster walls so we decided to buy 3 units. Since our purchase we not only have a solid WiFi signal everywhere in our house (and outside in the yards too) but the WiFi speed has increased as well. We’ve had plenty of devices running at the same time and have not seen any reduction in speed. Also the set up is very simple and user friendly. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to improve their WiFi connectivity!","positive"
"Ring vs Skybell comparison = Ring wins","Update 6/6/2017Someone pried the button off my doorbell and I had to interact with Ring customer service for the first time.  I'm upgrading them back to 5 stars because I was so impressed with my interaction (unlike Skybell).  I went on chat to see about buying a replacement button.  Zach told me they didn't offer replacement buttons but would be happy to replace the whole unit for me.  A few minutes later I had an order confirmation and a new unit on the way.  I'm impressed by how easy it was to contact them and how responsive they were.  On top of that I'm pretty sure a break-in to my neighbour's house was averted when a suspicious person came to look through her windows last night and she confront him through her Ring.Update 6/1/2016Finally got live view on my own Ring now.  Other members of my household got it a few weeks earlier than I did so they don't seem to roll it out by household but rather by individual account.Update 3/31/206Although my Ring has the latest firmware update (1.6.76) I still don't seem to have live view on my app.  According to the Ring support site this feature is being steadily rolled out and users will receive an email when their device has been enabled.  My neighbour's Ring has already been activated so I added a screenshot of what your Ring should look like with live view as an option.  Note : According to the support page on Live View you will only have this feature on the regular Ring if you are connected to doorbell wiring for power.Update 3/23/2016You might want to wait to get the new Ring Pro depending on your needs.  They just announced that they are accepting preorders for availability within the next couple of months (not available to preorder on Amazon yet.)  The new Pro version requires wired doorbell power while this current version allows battery.  The Pro version is 1080P instead of 720P and supposedly has better options around motion detection and night vision.  I'm curious to see if the Pro version will resolve some of the issues I've seen (and some of the criticisms other reviewers have) of the delay between a motion alert or doorbell ring and getting the alert on your phone.In my previous update 3/19/2016 I erroneously stated that only Ring Pro will have live view.  As Joe pointed out in the comments Live View should be available as a firmware update for existing Ring devices.  My device did not yet update so I cannot test this feature but once mine does I will check it out and update this review again!-------I bought the Skybell first because I hadn’t heard of Ring.  Due to a manufacturing issue where I started seeing the video feed of SOMEONE ELSE’S front door instead of mine I got a Ring instead.  I'm actually glad it happened because I prefer the Ring so much more to Skybell despite some of the limitations.Having had a chance to install both on my door here are my impressions:***Installation***Skybell comes with the bell a mounting plate and some instructions.  Screws were standard and installation was relatively straightforward.  Getting the doorbell to connect to our network was a PAIN.  It wasn’t able to connect via a 5G network plus it didn’t have strong enough signal strength so we had to get a second router for and set up a whole separate network for Skybell.Ring’s package impressed the heck out of me.  You get a little tool pouch with all the tools you need to set up the Ring including a screw driver drill bit self level and more.  If you are screwing into stucco (as I was) I don’t recommend you use the included drill bit.  The hole it drilled was a little large and I had to silicone caulk the hole afterwards to give the screws enough grip.  Ring connected to our network pretty seamlessly and didn’t need to have a separate network nor require the 2nd router.***Size***Ring is MUCH larger than Skybell.  I wish it was thinner but I understand there’s a lot to cram in.  The Ring does stick out quite a bit visually on my wall but worth it for what I get.  See attached photo to see the size difference.Skybell: 2.15cm / 0.8in thick 7.1cm / 2.8in diameterRing : 0.87in thick 4.98 tall by  x 2.43 inches wide***Battery / Power to the device***Skybell is fairly low powered so there is no battery attached to it.  It runs off the power from your doorbell so it cannot be mounted anywhere you do not have direct power.Ring is battery powered.  I charged it to about 60% via a USB cord first before I plugged it into the wall.  You can get some trickle power from the doorbell but depending on the weather and use you may find you drain the battery faster than it charges.  An hour after the bell has been plugged and with one test video call in I was at 57% battery.  Three days later it charged to 77%.  This might get annoying but it does mean Ring can be mounted anywhere not just where you have direct power.***Mobile App***Skybell only lets you have one user at a time.  If you want more than one person to have access to the video stream you have to share accounts.  I do like that you can see your doorbell on demand.  I like being able to check in on my door.  I understand that Ring is working on this but it’s not yet available.Ring lets you have multiple users.  The first installed user just has to send email invites to the other users.  Ring shows you recent activity but you need to pay a $3 a month subscription to see your videos on cloud.  I wish that wasn’t the case but $3 isn’t that bad.  I imagine I will upgrade for the cloud storage long term.In terms of use of app the Ring interface was relatively straightforward to use and understand.  I like being able to set the active zones for tracking motion so that you don't get too many false alarms.***Video on demand**Skybell : yes but I saw another person's front door too.Ring : not yet coming soon***Motion detection:***Skybell : YesRing: Yes***Video quality***I couldn’t find the specs on the Skybell.  Ring seemed to have slightly higher video quality in the day and slightly higher audio quality but this may be subjective.Please note : If you are expecting the quality that you get on your web cam or Facetime on an iPhone the quality will NOT be comparable. This is still early technology so the voice quality and video quality will be a bit crude.  I suspect the design team had to make some trade-offs between video quality and ability to power the unit via battery / trickle charge from the doorbell electrical wire.  That said I am able to identify the voices and recognize people in the camera so that for me is sufficient though of course I hope that future generations will continue to improve in this respect.  Ring's cloud recording page gives you a pretty accurate idea of what your videos would look like.***Lag / Delay between door bell ring and phone notification***Seems to be about the same on both.  There is a bit of a delay but for me that’s acceptable compared to the alternative of just missing the door altogether.***Customer Service***Haven't had to interact with Ring's customer service but Skybell's was so horrid I'm still upset about the interaction.  Skybell wanted me to ship my defective Skybell to them at my expense when it was broadcasting someone else's video stream instead of mine right from the start.  I get that it's expensive for them but it's NOT a way to win a customer.UPDATE : I actually did have to interact with Ring customer service and they impressed me greatly.  My doorbell button was probably tampered with and they issued an exchange no questions asked within minutes of contact.Overall between Skybell and Ring Ring wins for me hands down.","positive"
"Great Invention!","This is a great way to view who is coming to your door without opening the door.  You can even view and speak to whomever is there from a remote site so no one has to know that you aren't home. I have seen some reviews that mentioned that a thief or a scammer can tell that they are oncamera - that is a good thing not a bad one. I want this to be a deterrent to anyone standing at my door who shouldn't be.I was very pleased also by the customer service.  My motion sensor did not work although if the doorbell was used it notified me. After suggesting various very simple quick fixes - all by computer chat - the representative told me a replacement was on the way. It was overnighted and came to me right away. I simply had to return the defective unit in a paid return envelope. I would not hesitate to recommend this device and have already done so to many of my friends and neighbors.","positive"
"Great product","I love this product! I had mixed emotions when I ordered due to the polarizing reviews but (so far) I haven't experienced any of the issues posted by the negative reviews. I have the lowest internet speed available and my images are very clear and have only been delayed once. I also bought the chime and you can set it to any volume as well as going off only for rings or motion. I did keep the default settings to 5' rather than extending the zone. If you increase the zone it will pick up traffic driving by. Overall I'm very pleased and think it's worth the money.Update: they've now added a Live View option through the app so you can activate the video and voice on demand. I love it even more!","positive"
"Great for budget conscious and novice users | I returned mine and upgraded it.","I ordered this during Black Friday week and got it at a discounted price.  I used it to replace a competitive video doorbell from a security company.  The biggest weakness of the security company doorbell was the lack of a Wi-Fi chime and the cost to upload video clips per month.  Therefore I also picked up the Ring Chime to help provide some additional coverage space for the notification.The product was easy to unpack.  I like the fact that screws a screw driver and a USB cable were provided for recharging.  I do recommend a pair of wire-strippers for wired doorbells - the leads on my doorbell were very short and were not long enough to wrap around the screw posts.  If you are replacing a wired doorbell the AC voltage provided by your doorbell transformer seems to trickle charge the built-in battery.  I couldn't find any specifications on how long the internal battery will last - which makes me wonder if a doorbell replacement will be necessary even with hardwired power at some point in the future.For those of you with wired doorbells I do recommend initially charging the doorbell first to 100% before you install it. The trickle charge is just that - don’t expect the wired doorbell transformer to charge it to 100% for you. It might - it’ll just take a long time.Setup is incredibly simple and requires a smartphone.  It seriously took longer to wire and install than it did to program the doorbell module.  The built-in videos within the Ring app were easy to follow and did not require much prior research to get started.The Ring Chime was also incredibly simple to configure and get connected to the doorbell.  For those of you on the fence wondering if the chime is worth it - it absolutely is for larger homes. Our mechanical chime is not loud enough to hear throughout our home and digital wired chimes cost more than Ring’s adapter.  There are a number of built-in chimes you can choose from.  I didn't see any method of adding your own or Ring having the ability to download some from their website.The install was not a perfect experience on my part though but was pretty darn close.  Here are the two things that I ran into that might help some of you.First my mailbox was located near where the doorbell has been typically placed.  It was a Wi-Fi shield even though my router is a room away behind the door along the same outer wall.  While the Ring app stated that my Wi-Fi was OK it was choppy enough that I had issues connecting to the doorbell and getting good picture quality.  I moved my mailbox and the signal dramatically improved - video quality and connection are instantaneous now.  Don’t accept OK for your Wi-Fi connection.  It needs to be “Good” or better for a pleasant experience.Second my FiOS router had the 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi channel set to a static channel assignment.  Ring did not like this for some reason even though I have a solid symmetrical 100Mb connection (up and down) and this was after the mailbox experience ;-).  I could not get notifications on my device or to the Ring Chime module.  I had to set the channel assignment to auto and got everything working perfectly.All in all it was well worth the money.  However I ended up returning it.  In my housing plan EVERYONE has a wireless router with 2.4ghz turned on. There was way too much congestion to have the Ring keep a good solid signal  Given no 5ghz WiFi is supported with this specific model I returned it and exchanged it for a Ring Doorbell Pro model.For those of you not in crowded neighborhoods this may work well for you. However technophiles should go with the ‘Pro’ model.","positive"
"Very Nice Add to your Smart Home","Finally ordered and installed the Ring Doorbell.  Installed it as a hard wire over our existing doorbell hard wired placement.  Very easy to install although had some slight adjustments to make on the back plating to ensure that it was straight to snap in the cover.  After I was able to adjust everything locking the cover in place with the screws was easy.  Suggest installing the app before physically installing the unit as there are a couple of videos on the app that will give you some guidance on how to do the physical installation.  I assigned the app to provide notifications to multiple people in the house and everything works great.  Motion detection was a little tricky as I needed to adjust for detection distance.  Only small issues we've had were some slight delays in notifications when ringing the doorbell on occasion which was probably due to internet or server congestion.  The infrared detection is very reliable as we also have a security camera on the Ring Doorbell also and I feel that the motion detection is a little better on Ring than my camera!  After about 2 weeks we are very pleased about the Ring Doorbell performance.  Highly recommend as an addition to your smart home.","positive"
"Genius gadget for your family's safety!!!","BEST PRODUCT EVERY INVENTED!  This is a VIDEO doorbell that set off by MOTION  and people RINGING your doorbell with intergraded cameras and 2 way audio that is sent immediately to your smartphone (Android or Apple).  So even if you are shopping or at work you can talk to the people over your smart phone and they have no idea if you are in the house or away!I have to tell you about this product because it has been a tremendous help in identifying the person who has been steeling our packages and has been a blessing for proof that our UPS guy has left my stolen packages on the front patio of our condo so he doesn't get blammed. Since I order everything possible from Amazon Smiles I get packages every day. I was searching for a doorbell that would ring on all 3 floors of my condo through wifi when I found this product!  I have Nest Drop Cams in my house to watch my dogs and record if anyone breaks in hurts my animals or steels anything.  The RING DOORBELL is my #1 defense against people wandering onto my patio and taking my plants and packages and doing any harm if they were to break in.  Thanks to the RING DOORBELL I have been able to show the police the videos and catch the people who are the perpetrators!This is how simple it works...I do not have a wired doorbell (which you can wire it to) or you can use the battery that comes with it.  I have my RING set to MOTION as well as when someone rings the bell.  I had to drill into concrete for the base.  It was easy because RING gives you the correct size drill bit along with everything needed for installation.  All you need is a drill.  It literally took me all of 15 minutes to instal the amazing gadget!  The best part is that anyone that would want to steel it they really have no choice to be caught on video and it does have a special screw that you would need to remove it from the base.  I do believe that RING offers you a free replacement if it is stolen!I easily set the RING doorbell to notify my husband and I when there is motion or someone rings the doorbell.  There are no problems with adding more than one user in case one of us is busy.  (You can also add-on other cameras around your house.) We get a distinct chime ring on our iPhones instantly and tap the RING App and we can see and have a two-way conversation with whoever is at the door!  Sometimes I answer the door from my third floor office without having to run down to the front door.  With packages that need signatures this is a huge help since the US postal service never gives me enough time to get down stairs to sign for packages; they are always in a hurry and leave before I can get to the door!It is amazing when someone is on your property wait until you get their face on camera and then say Can I help you?  We have had people taping flyers on our door solicitors and as soon as I say Can I help you they either try to sell something and I can say No thank you or they RUN!  if you pay the $30/ year which is a lot less than the Drop Cams $9/month you can go back and review all the videos.  That is how the police were able to catch the guys steeling packages  not just from our patio but our neighbors.There are videos on YouTube on how to instal the RING Doorbell trouble shooting and more for easy to follow help and you get 30 days free recording so you can decide to pay for the service if you want to keep recordings!.I am going to give these out to my each of my family members for the holidays.  The gift of safety and confidence is priceless!","positive"

"Works perfect.","Fast shipping. This is a very cool product. We have 0 delay when the button is pushed on the Ring doorbell like some people are saying. From what little I know is I think people with a long delay when the ring button is pushed is because they have 'slow cell phone service'. Video quality is great and the sound is clear. We are old and slow so my wife had to call Customer Support four times on the day I installed it. All four times they answered their phone by the 5th ring. Very friendly and helpful people which is rare now days. Both of our cell phones get 'rung' when the doorbell is pushed. Even while the wife was at work the motion sensor notified someone was at the door it was me. We had a 10 minute conversation using the Ring doorbell she could see me but of course I couldn't see her. The sound was very clear. I think it was worth the $200 we paid :)","positive"
"Caught stealing","Literally just installed and caught someone stealing our packages the same day. Sent video to our local police and they currently have them in custody. Found out they were also stealing our mail and trying to use our credit cards.The only thing I have issue with is that it is not able to tilt or move so camera is not able to show packages on the floor.Another issue is that if you want to change internet connection you have do take the whole thing down and do set up all over again.Overall it's one of the best purchases we've ever made.","positive"

"Battery is not as advertised.... ** updated**","**** UPDATE:I originally stated in my review below that I would not purchase the ring pro and spend more money on one of their products. In the interest of honesty I have to say I realized that ring is the best product of its kind and went and purchased the ring pro. Shortly after this purchase a representative at ring saw my review and contacted me. She was great! Within minutes I had a credit in the form of a PayPal payment for the full retail price of my ring pro and was told I could keep my original ring!I now join the throngs of customers that rave about ring customer support! I am a totally satisfied customer and the ring pro is amazing but that is a review I'll post on the ring pro side. Thank you Ring!Let me start by saying I love the doorbell and for the most part it functions as it should albeit not ringing a few times and getting phone calls from food delivery places telling me they're standing at the front door.The battery.... Ohhhh the battery. Lasts a couple months one time then a month another time. Always charging. Called ring and they were not receptive of upgrading me to a pro doorbell. I told them I was now going to run wires to hardwire (which I didn't want to do originally) and told them had I known I was going to run wires I would have bought the pro version. Again they were not willing to return and upgrade.There is a reason they came out with ring doorbell 2 with a detachable battery. Even then I'm sure you'll be constantly charging. At least include 2 batteries to swap out instead of it being out of commission while charging.Anyway that's my story. Maybe I'll try a different brand because I am not giving them more of my money to upgrade to a pro at full retail price.","positive"
"Always be home smart features highly customizable highly recommended","I absolutely love this doorbell. Our single chime we have in our home is on the main floor and we would be home and not hear the doorbell when we were in the basement or upstairs.Camera*For us it works great. The camera is good quality you can see a car driving all the way down our street and see what is going on across the street at the neighbors house. Our front door and porch is fairly wide open after we got ours my father wanted one so I helped him install his at his house. When we turned on the video the image looked terrible he has a long deep hall kind of a front door so the image is all distorted by the light at the end of the tunnel. I have heard several people complain about that so think about what your front door is like before buying or be willing to place the doorbell in a creative location.Talking through the camera*I have successfully had conversations with my front door guest with me hundreds of miles away. It is wonderful I can clearly see who is at my door and be able to say hey im at the store I'll be there in five I think the door is unlocked go ahead and go in or whatever. It is a great feature.Recording*The recording is amazing and it is only $30/ year for the service. I do quite a bit of transactions of craigslist where I have people come to my home well now I have a video of them just incase they steal harm or threaten me in anyway. It is very easy to email a video clip to a friend or the police you never know what you might need.App*The app is easy to use but I have noticed just a few times that the app fails from time to time right when somebody rings so I don't get a notification or realize but I have extra chimes now which are easy to use so I still know somebody is there. The live view feature is wonderful when your traveling you can check on the house easily. You can just check to see if you have a package or whatever very convenient.Motion detection*We get several notifications of cars driving by because engines put off quite a bit of heat and this product isn't just simple motion its a moving heat signature very cool but it picks up cars often. You can adjust the motion distance but cars are so hot that 1 of 4 cars that drives by is picked up on the camera. If somebody doesn't want to be filmed they try to just knock on your front door but surprise they are being filmed anyways not just filmed but audio is recorded too! Same with somebody dropping off a flyer.Installation*Don't be intimated by this at all! You download the app and there are several videos of step by step what exactly to do anybody could install this trust me trust yourself you can do it! I was reading alot and watching all the videos when I was installing so the first time took me about 40 minutes. The second time I installed one it took me about 10 minutes.","positive"
"Search No More This IS the Doorbell You Are Looking For...","Best doorbell EVER!! When I got it I waited a couple of days to put it in. I wasn't sure if the broken doorbell out front actually worked or not so I got this model because it can run off low voltage or battery.  Took off the old doorbell button and installed this thing in less than 10 minutes. I actually had to install it on the molding around the door frame and it still looks great.  All you do is connect the 2 wires to the 2 screws on the mounting plate and attach it to the wall.  Once installed simply setup your account and user settings and let the fun begin.  It's like Christmas every day. I get to see who comes up to my door when no one is home. You can set it up to alert you when someone comes within the CUSTOMIZABLE motion zones. I can even talk to my family when they come and go from the house. I'm thinking about getting some of the Ring cameras for the back and side of the house as well.","positive"
"Excellent device and FUN to use","Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video DoorbellI've had my Ring for almost 2 weeks now and it works GREAT!Problems I had on start up:1. My iPhone was not set up right. I had to turn on Microphone and Camera in the Ring App after downloading and activating it.2. A week WiFi signal at the Ring Doorbell location was detected by using the Speed test at bandwidthplace.com (recommended by Ring Support). I ran the test next to the modem then at the Ring Doorbell location. It was at or above 2.0 download at the modem and below 1.0 Mbps at the Ring Doorbell. Ring Support recommends at LEAST above 1.0 at the Ring DB.3. The low WiFi signal prevented the video from appearing on the iPhone every time: The modem is in a metal Communication cabinet in the laundry room. I did a temporary fix by taking the metal door off the Comm Cabinet. I've ordered a WiFi extender for a permanent fix. Ring support suggested one of these:a. TP Link - TL-WA850RE WiFi Range Extenderb. Netgear - EX2700 WiFi Range Extenderc. If the extender doesn't work then I'll relocate the Modem.4. My wired doorbell button is in a wall perpendicular to the front door. I temporarily placed the Ring DB there and pressed the Button. The video generated showed my profile and did not get a full on face shot. So I relocated it to the Door Frame just above the door knob facing down the driveway. Now the video records a full face shot of the guest.5. Like Munchiniwa observed on April 17 2015 it appears that motion detect is a bit delayed and you do get the back of someone who does not hang around.a. With that said a Termite inspection guy set off the motion detector and I answered it while several miles away from the house. I engaged him for his business and told him I was indisposed and to come another time after his office called to set up a time. He thought I was home during the entire conversation. The video is a Hoot!! Here's a link to watch it: https://ring.com/share/34365502. REMEMBER I was several miles away from the house when I was talking to the guy. How cool is that!6. Also Munchiniwas noted he could not access his videos on a computer. That is correct for live feeds and interaction with a Guest at the door. However you can log in at Ring.com and select Activity to view and download any video taken by the Ring DB. You can also email the video via an email icon in the Ring.com site under Activity.I've shared my experience with a few friends and they have committed to purchasing a Ring Video Doorbell.I hope this helped with your understanding of the Ring DB and gave you some better insight on it.Thanks for taking the time to read this [...]","positive"
"Works almost  TOO good!","Not only does the ring accomplished what it was designed to do keep an eye on visitors but I find it's another great tool for parent with young adults.  It's helps me make sure curfews are met and they aren't bring in friends while we're at work. :-)The only downside is my cat now uses it to let us know when he wants let in the house... at 4AM!!!!Update one month later.  Still getting great use out of my video doorbell but recently started having trouble with the recording.  In the past week it has randomly stopped recording movement TWICE and then started up again a day or so later. Working with support to troubleshoot and they suggested resetting the device next time it happens.  I will update the review if it happens again.I am waiting to purchase the flood light camera next...once I'm sure the doorbell will continue working.","positive"
"Wow I'm impressed!","After someone recently rifled through my car parked in the carport we decided to get the Ring Video Doorbell. After reading reviews and doing some research I purchased two doorbells on Amazon. I received them two days later and was able to install them and get them working within a couple of hours. I'm 68 years old so if I can do it ANYBODY can do it! We are very pleased with the quality of the video and audio. We were out of town for a few days and was able to see our mailman and some neighbors who rang the doorbells while we were gone. We decided to subscribe to the cloud storage service since it's reasonably priced and gives us the opportunity to download the videos at a later date.","positive"
"Received it today installed it tested it and all ready LOVE it!","Got the package in faster than Amazon (Prime) said awesome. To the Ring now I opened up the package and it is well designed. Everything you need to set it up and install it is there. You know every product you buy comes with some ways to set it up. Even a new smartphone anything needs your attention. Not with the Ring! This is sooooo easy to set up my 5 yr old could do it. Open the box get everything out lay it out on your table and start charging your device while you go through the box and the content. Go to your app store and download the Ring app easy... Open the app and it will literally tell you what to do. I never (and I repeat never) experienced such an easy installation progress. I added my wifes email addres my ipad my sons ipad my phone... Literally like 1-2-3! Than when all was set and done do the test by pushing the button and it works just like that! I also bought a chime for the livingroom. Simple set up plug it in go to Ad Device click click click and done. Do the test! Bang it works love it. We left the doorbell in the livingroom and our 5yr old was the assistant to listen to us and ring the doorbell. We tried all of our phones and ipads they all get a notification and we can all watch and talk with the Ring device at the same time. The 5yr old thought this was the coolest thing ever invented since his iPad.Ok installing it at the frontdoor... Took the box with me took my existing doorbell off disconnected two wires. Took the Ring backplate matked four holes drilled the holes with drill that came in the box 1-2-3 easy screws in the plate slide the Ring on it. Two screws underneath.. Done! Back in the housem kids rang the bell all devices got allerts... I set the motion sensors a couple times (fine tuning) and I guess we are all good!Gosh this thing is amazing! I can 't wait to communicate with friends UPS people track who swings by... Or even send strangers away. Even as I write it my motion sensor sends a message to my iPad. I click on it and immediately see the front side of our home.. I notice the wind blows my palm tree swings a little because of the wind but most importantly nobody there.. And that 's what I like! Sets my mind at easy... You never know who shows up at your house. I am sure this Ring will give us a lot more peace of mind for sure when we are not home. I know I need to finetune the sensors again set them less sensitive but that is cool in the app. Did I mention the app was easy peasy? Go buy it I thought about it for a couple days but trust me just buy it. We are not affiliated with Ring or the company behind it just a GREAT product!","positive"
"They are easy to use and generally dependable and stay on-line","I'm a camera answer gadget person.  I have Nest (formerly Dropcam) FLIR FX and Netcam.  All are different and Nest is the only one I buy a yearly subscription to for 2 cameras.  It is also the most stable.  I’ve watched RING ever since it was on Shark Tank but just bought one a couple of weeks ago.  One way I review the quality of my gadgets is if my wife uitilizes the app.  She uses the Nest and now she uses the RING both regularly.  They are easy to use and generally dependable and stay on-line.  I have been impressed with how quickly RING picks up on motion and gives the alert without false alerts.  All technology has hiccups but this is one that seems to have its act together and I would recommend it and will probably buy a subscription when my free trial is up.","positive"
"My dad loves it!","I purchased this for my father who spends a lot of time in his home office and often doesn't hear people at the door.  It was his father's day gift.  He wasn't exactly sure what it was until I installed it for him and showed him.  He loves it!  He usually has his cell phone near by and the fact this uses his cell is convenient for him.I opened the box and made sure it had all of the tools and parts needed to install.  The unit arrived with the battery at 45% charge.  I downloaded the app for his phone and used it to connect the doorbell to his home network.  It took me about 4 minutes to get it paired.  The Ring app walked me through it which made it nice and easy.Once the unit was connected to his home wifi network I found a place to install it.  The front of his house is rock which worried me at first.  But there were instructions for mounting on rock.  In the app you choose how were and on what surface you are going to install the unit and it brings up the right videos to walk you through the process.  I chose to mount it near the old doorbell to use the wires for a hard wired system.  I attached the level and put the back plate where it was going to go.  I marked the holes with a pencil then drilled the holes using the included drill bit.  Including the drill bit was a nice touch.  Many products tell me what size bit to use but I have never seen one included.  After I drilled the 4 holes I inserted the plastic pieces.  I removed the level and put the back plate against the wall and inserted the screws.After the back plate was installed I simply put the doorbell on the back plate and slide it down on the hooks.  I tightened the two screws on the bottom to lock it in place.  That was it.We mounted it about 4 feet off the ground which worried me at first that it wouldn't catch people's faces.  After testing it I realized that was a good height.  My face is perfectly visible on the phone screen.  We did not experience any delay when talking to people at the front door from the basement.  It was loud and clear on both ends.I definitely recommend this item to anybody who doesn't always hear people at the door and could use their phone with this product.  My dad is also pretty happy about the security it provides when he is away.  He plans to talk to people as if he was home but couldn't immediately answer the door.","positive"
"Who's There?","With almost 13000 reviews we’re not sure what we can add to describe how great the Ring Video Doorbell is!  However this is such a great product; we felt the need to share our opinion and experiences so hopefully this review will help others.We installed the standard Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell at our front door.  Installation was simplicity at its finest…simply replaced the existing wired door bell using the mounting items supplied.  The only thing we had to supply was a drill.  Using the “wired option” enables one of the most useful features….Live View.  Live View lets us look at activity on the front porch at anytime from anywhere.  The doorbell has lived up to all of our expectations.There is a treasure trove of information (including videos) on the Ring web site that can answer just about any question you might have about the product the installation and operation.  The only downside that others have mentioned is the $30/year fee for the Cloud Recording function that stores up to 6 months of video on the Ring servers.  In our opinion this is a small price to pay for the additional convince and security of off-site storage of a video that could become very important if you have an incident that the doorbell captures.With all of the documentation available on the Ring web site and the details provided here on Amazon we decided to present an extremely abbreviated list of Pros and Cons.PROS•  Simple installation.  Package included everything (except labor and a drill) needed for a first class installation.•  Quick setup.  Had the unit up and operating in less than 10 minutes from the time we downloaded the app until we were looking at the first picture over WiFi.•  Doorbell can also be operated on battery.  Great for those who do not have a location with power for the doorbell.  All you lose on battery is the Live View function and who knows maybe a new version of the app will enable this function :-)CONS•  Fee required for Cloud Recording.  Not a show stopper for us but something to consider for those on a budget.  While the fee isn’t excessive recurring costs can mount over time.This is a quality product that appears to be very durable.  Recommend you consider this product if you want the additional safety security and convenience of remotely answering your door.  This product was not provided as a sample for this review.  None of these comments are influenced in any way by the seller.","positive"
"Windows 10 app makes it a winner","There's enough reviews on the unit itself so I won't go on about that - it's not perfect but it is one of the best of it's class right now.  What really puts the Ring video doorbell over the top is that they  have a Windows 10 app (most competing products do not have one yet).  Being able to get alerts on any device I'm using at the time (and not JUST my phone) is a true game changer.  This way if I'm working at my desktop or laptop I can view and respond directly to any alerts w/out switching to my phone.  Also being able to view the video on a big screen instead of just a tiny little phone screen is great.  On top of that I can now leave live view of the video up on my PC as much as I want and not worry about draining my phone battery.  It's a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app so it works great on any size device from a full desktop to a laptop to a tablet or even phone and potentially any other device that comes along in the future.  Hopefully they'll let it run on the Xbox One soon too!","positive"
"Took a little extra effort to get going but love this doorbell now!","After reading some of the less-than-positive reviews here I was hesitant to get this but a trusted neighbor had one for a while and said it works well for them. And now I can say I love our Ring doorbell too; but it took a while to get it setup and working with our devices. Although the review here says I ordered the white color I actually ordered the bronze which matches our house colors perfectly. The camera is very clear (much sharper image than the Honeywell wireless cameras we got with our security system) and having the ability to talk to someone from anywhere is priceless to us (we recently had our landscaper show up unexpectedly and being able to answer his ring and talk to him gave us peace of mind that he wasn't going to anything that we hadn't agreed to). The doorbell itself was relatively easy to install and connect to our Wi-Fi network although at first it didn't work with our Android (Samsung) phones (we didn't get the notifications when someone came to the door).  It also would not trigger our existing doorbell which is an old-style mechanical type (strikes a bell when triggered instead of playing a chime or tone) even though I wired it as shown in the installation instructions.  My husband wanted to send it back but I convinced him that first we needed to give the support folks at Ring a try.  I'm really glad we did as Ring customer service was very helpful in assisting with trouble-shooting the problems we encountered. It turned out there was a known issue with some Samsung devices not receiving notifications but during the time they worked with us it was resolved for the Samsung 6S.  The second issue with the wired Ring not making our mechanical doorbell sound turned out to be a problem with the Ring device we received so they shipped us a new unit (and covered the shipping costs for us to return the old one).  The new unit install went quickly and now both our upstairs and downstairs mechanical doorbells both sound.  During this process we learned that the Live View option was available with our device (since it's hardwired to our old doorbell) which allows you to use the camera at any time to check your door area and the customer service rep requested it be turned on for us.  Within a day we were using Live View.  My husband loves this feature and keeps showing it to everyone he knows. The only remaining issue we have is now is receiving push notifications on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 which is another known Android problem that is being worked on.  The reason I'm giving 5 stars despite this remaining problem is the speed at which the other issues we encountered were resolved as it gives me confidence that this one will soon be resolved as well.  In the meantime it's working perfectly with the other Samsung S6 phone and our iPad.This past weekend I purchased and installed a Ring doorbell for my best friend for her birthday who receives a lot of packages for her job and can't always make it to the door in time.  Unfortunately she didn't have an existing wired doorbell to replace so it's currently being powered by the internal battery.  Given this she can't get the Live View feature (apparently this would deplete the battery).  We've been monitoring the battery but so far (it's only been installed a few days) the power level is still at 100%.  She is going to have her electrician install a low-voltage transformer and resistor to connect the Ring doorbell to and then she can get Live View added.  Both she and her husband have Samsung phones and iPad's and the notifications are working well on all of their devices. Please note I am not affiliated in any way with the Ring company nor am I being compensated in any way for this review.  Being a gadget geek I just want to share my experiences with others who may be interested in this device.","positive"

"Alexa hits another home run","I purchased this in a bundle and was happy when it finally all came in.  Yes it did not come all together.  It paired without problems and updated itself in about 10 minutes.  The sound is rich and room filling with very little distortion.  Alexia responds and adjusts in a few seconds.  The sound is even better than the first which was good considering its limitations. This is the wilder  louder and better sister.  LOL I use it every day and have to say it is Awesome. If you have trouble pairing delete the set and then recreate the set.  it works A+  If this was helpful please indicate I purchased this and use it daily.","positive"
"Alexa is my new fun!!!","I love Alexa the sound is clear when playing music and the bass sounds great","positive"
"Well worth money GREAT SOUND","I baught the dot a week before this one was released and was very satisfied with the dot except for sound quality for playing music. I am a Bose fan but didn’t want to  spend the extra money on the bows that is compatible with Alexa so decided to get this and I absolutely love it the sound quality is amazing not quite as good as a Bose but definitely well worth the money saved by buying this and not the Bose for nowP.S  other upside is I can pair this with my diet and play the music throughout the house and Talk to somebody that could be in the other room","positive"

"Surprisingly better sound than my first Echo.","I thought it would be hard to improve the sound from my first Echo in such a compact unit but they accomplished that in this Echo plus. I have used the built in hub yet because I mainly use it for music when I'm cooking. But I'm sure I'll eventually venture into the Alexa controlled gadgets before long. I'm completely satisfied so far and I don't expect that to change. If you're even thinking about buying one go ahead and do it you won't regret it. Thank you guys and God bless.","positive"

"Clearly better than the Echo 2nd Gen version","This review is for the stereo paired Echo Plus's with the Echo Sub. I first bought the system with just the Echo 2nd Generatons. It sounded quite good as I said in my review of that system. Even the two Echos by themselves sounded surprisingly good. Two Echos in stereo sound much better than one.But I couldn't help feeling that the system with the Echo Plus's would sound better. So I bought the Echo Plus version and prepared to send back the Echo version. And the Echo Plus do indeed sound quite significantly better than the system with just the Echos. It's a much fuller sound and the treble definitely gets a boost as it should from the larger tweeter. The native base of the Echo Plus's add a true character to the overall sound. In my opinion the $80 more this system costs over the Echo version is definitely worth it. Superior sound that is much more significant than I thought it would be. This sounds as good as anything I've heard and it's in stereo at $330. That to me says deal!They look better too. They're a bit broader and it looks good. Curiously they weigh an ounce less than the Echos. They also don't have the Amazon logo painted on like the Echos. The Sandstone color which I have come with a white cord. The Echos had a black cord. They may all come with a white cord. White is better. They were actually delivered in the same box the next day. Thanks Amazon Prime! This system is just remarkable. Highly recommended.","positive"
"Amazing new features","I think the product is amazing. It was easy to set up. I was able to set up light fixtures and home music system. I have morning routines programmed as well as my daily calendar.Love this product!!!","positive"
"Dynamite comes in small packages.","This thing is awesome! Excellent bass and overall sound quality and the built-in smart light hub is pretty sweet. It exceeded my expectations.","positive"
"Great sound and better than Siri","I like the great sound quality and it’s a great improvement from our previous speaker setup where we had to use an aux cable. I think it looks great and is aesthetically pleasing. I don’t like the fact I cannot use YT music through it yet because I’m sure they want to sell Amazon Premium Music subscriptions. But being a prime customer there is still a wide range of music access with no ads. I just enabled whisper mode yesterday and seems like that’s a great addition to keep the kids asleep.","positive"
"Great that we can pair them together.","After some troubleshooting it turns out that one of my Echo Plus devices had a connection issue and was cutting out. I was contacted immediately about the issue and a replacement will arrive two days from now. Looking forward to enjoying the setup when the replacement arrives. I can tell already that this is a big upgrade from the previous version.","positive"
"Great information tool","Home","positive"
"I love that it is nice and compact and includes the hub.","I've had problems trying to use all my smart devices with prior Echo devices but this one was a breeze to setup and get all my devices connected to it.  I may just buy another one so I can have stereo sound.","positive"
"Love love love it","Love it but have a few issues with sound","positive"
"We're having a lot of fun","Us kids gave Dad this echo plus to help him out. We ask it many questions. Play a little music on it. Have a lot of problem getting the old music. Usually when you ask Alexa for a song it brings up some modern garbage. We're working on the way we ask Alexa. We got the Phillips Hue in a few rooms and Dad just gets a kick out of the lights coming on just by talking. It helps us because I'm pushing him in a wheelchair. Mostly we're just having a lot of fun. I look forward to purchasing other items for Alexa. We got the echo dot 3rd gen. as well. Just one little complaint is that the microphone doesn't seem to be the best. Sometimes we have to outright yell at Alexa.","positive"

"Really cool","I have had the echo dots in every room of the house. My son wanted to get this for the kitchen. The sound is awesome! I’m very happy with it. Actually (no idea why) I didn’t even have to set it up. I turned it on and opened my Alexa app and it automatically added itself. The damnedest thing. Anyhoo really cool.

"Excellent Extra Security","We had increased reports of vandalism in the neighborhood. I wanted a bit more security without spending a fortune. After a lot of research I decided to get a Ring Video Doorbell.  I'm very impressed!!  The system came with easy instructions and everything needed to install it.  I had it unpacked and installed in less than 30 minutes.  Programming and synching with my cellphone was easy.  The Ring system detects motion from my house to across the street. Sensitivity can be adjusted easily.  I can answer my front door without opening the door which is especially helpful at night.  Quality of audio and video are excellent.  I'm pleased with this system and feel more secure.  Also when I'm away I can still monitor my home and contact the police if needed.","positive"
"Love the Ring products!","I looked around for a security system that fit my needs. I looked into ADT and other similar systems. They were all expensive...and BTW ADT uses Ring doorbells! I read lots of reviews and finally landed on a Ring doorbell for the front a ring stick-up cam with a solar panel for the back a chime for downstairs and a chime extender for upstairs. I could not be happier! Easy to install just like they said the pics are high def I tried talking and my spouse could hear me perfectly. I get alerts for motion on both cameras and alerts for rings on the front doorbell. All the ring products sync on the app...I love this system so much that I'm also going to purchase 2 of the new flood lights with motion. Sensors and a camera. You do have to pay a fee for iCloud but only 30.00 a year for two cameras....ADT is 50.00 a month. The Ring system fits my needs.","positive"
"Not a bad unit but it needs two improvements especially a programming change for people who live 40 feet from their street","I first bought this unit in 2016 and only gave it three stars at that time because I was unable even with CustServ help to get it to both 1) see people walking up onto my porch and 2) NOT see cars driving by 40 feet away. I complained to them about battery life and too many car alerts. I told myself if they ever fixed my complaints I'd revisit this review.Almost 12 months later I dusted off the box and TRIED again. I again contacted Ring's Customer Service and this time a new agent Jeffrey was able to get it working AS I WANTED IT TO. Part of his method was to send me a NEW doorbell (lifetime warranty) and introduce me to new products that they invented. (I wonder if they invented those new products because of my 2016 complaints). Spacers now allow me to adjust the doorbell angle downward by 5° 10° or 15°. They also created a solar charger. They effectively answered all of my complaints.I am very happy to change my rating to FIVE STARS. The 2018 version of the Ring Wi-Fi enabled Video Doorbell is a vast improvement over their 2016 doorbell and INFINITELY better than my old (boring) doorbell. I would give Jeffrey TEN stars if I could.LATE 2017 SUMMARY:I finally decided to try again got out the bell recharged the battery but it wouldn't work at all this time so I e-mailed Customer Support. Jeffrey wrote back then called me and held my hand every step of the way. He diagnosed that I had a bad doorbell sent me a replacement unit for free even though it had been almost 12 months since purchase and we got it working. When I continued to have occasional alerts from passing cars he sent me some wedges to try which cured that problem; and when I worried about how often I'd have to charge the battery he made sure I got a solar charger to try.The unit at 15° detected some cats walking across my porch so I now have it at 10° and it works great. I have it aimed at a 45° angle with a neighbor-made bracket from last year. At 10° and with my car parked where it is I don't get any passing car alerts.  It recognizes people when they get to my steps. This doorbell is well worth FIVE STARS.A year ago I said that if they could fix these problems and especially make it less likely to see cars and not require me to charge the battery anywhere near as often; that I'd upgrade my rating. Well they did. The new unit is better quality they invented angle spacers to not recognize cars as much and they came up with a solar charger which (even though my house faces north) is getting enough ambient light to not discharge much during winter. I look forward to summer charging when the morning sun will come in under the porch on my north side door.Thank you Jeffrey for AMAZING customer service.IMAGES:0. Not shown: When Doorbell was mounted at 0° (default position) I occasionally detected a car on the street 40 feet from the door.1. When I mounted the doorbell at a 15° downward angle it occasionally gave me motion alerts for cats crossing the porch. Cat's image used without cat's permission.2. Not shown: Since I remounted it at a 10° downward angle it has not told me about any cats nor has it told me of any cars. I believe I have struck a happy medium.","positive"
"There products have steadily improved & I'm so pleased with all their products performance","I've purchased Ring products from their beginnings. The owner & staff & the most helpful of any customer service ever encountered & that in itself is an achievement for those who felt with typical lacking cust Serv. There products have steadily improved & I'm so pleased with all their products performance. I read other posts mentioning colder climates battery issues but I own a cabin at 8000 elevation near a ski resort & I've never had any problems. These products are awaken for individuals who travel away from their homes to monitor activity by motion sensors that alert right to owners smart phones! U can view your locations from anywhere in the country. Awesome products regardless of other competition pretenders. Ring in the King in my long term use of their Ring products & Ring Stick up cams. Once you try the products you'll soon wonder why everyone's not utilizing these modern day technical wonders. Door bells of the past are obsolete compared to the Ring devices. Long Live Ring!!! Thank you for bringing these wonderful products for wise consumers to appreciate.","positive"
"Happy with our Ring","We installed our Ring a couple of weeks ago and are pleased so far.  We are still tinkering with the motion settings but install configuration and performance have lived up to expectations.  The package came with all the tools we needed to install it.  I was on break at work when Ring alerted me about motion at the front door.  Wife was letting our dog out and when they came back up on the porch I started talking to them... Dog was puzzling at the Ring trying to figure out where I was.  I also noticed that the Amazon driver takes a photo of stuff he delivers once he sets it on our porch.  I'm sure we'll see other interesting things on our Ring videos hopefully all good.I wired the Ring to our conventional doorbell circuit and the battery has maintained a 100% charge even with frequent use of the live view feature.  Other reviews have mentioned the surprising coverage area of the lens.  As can be seen in the photos Ring captures our entire porch most of the front yard and the three houses across the street day and night.My only concern was how to mount it beside the door as the wood trim wasn't flat and not quite wide enough.  I mounted the base on the wood trim extending onto the vinyl siding. Then I carefully filled the gaps behind the base with a bead of adhesive caulk to make for a more solid attractive installation (pictured).  If you do that just be careful not to slop any caulk over the edge of the base and onto the front surface where it mates with the Ring housing and electric contacts have to be made.  We’re happy with the functionality of our Ring so plan on paying the $30 yearly subscription to save and store the videos.Ring provides quite a bit of security at a reasonable price and was dirt simple to install and set up.","positive"
"Easy installation great features reasonable price","The setup and installation of this unit is very easy and there are many videos from the manufacturer that make the installation process really seamless.  This is one of videos that is helpful (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq1ZLRY7JVc).Setting up the unit to join the home WiFi is also simple enough.  You have to download the ring app on your IOS or Android and it has the setup feature in the app.  The ring device starts to advertise an SSID for WiFi that your IOS or Android has to join temporarily.  That allows the app to interface with the doorbell and configure it for the your personal WiFi network.The quality of the video is outstanding and very surprising with the 180 degrees coverage and how clear the video shows up.  some reviews on Amazon talk about delay or showing only the back side of the people as they leave.  However I didn't notice any of these issues.  Once the door bell rings I see the notification on my phone and iPad about half a second later.  When I answer the call the video shows up and both the video and voice quality is very clear.The unit comes with 30 days of cloud recording feature and additional $30 / year will buy the cloud video storage for safe keeping and just in case you can not answer the door at the time someone rings the bell but want to check later using the motion sensor and video recording feature.I wish the unit would have included at least one WiFi enabled Chime to allow the door bell ring inside the house as well.  But the chimes are sold separately and seems like they're usually hard to find.  So I ordered two chimes directly from Ring at $29 each and they work great.  I have installed one on the main floor and the other on the second floor.  The chimes are configured the same way as the doorbell to add them to the home WiFi using the same Ring app on the IOS or Android device. Also each Chime unit can be configured to go off for either motion or door bell or both as well as you control the volume of each chime from the same app.","positive"
"Wi-Fi Video Doorbell Fits the Bill","We bought the Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell after reading several reviews. We do not have wiring for a doorbell so were especially interested in something that would not require wiring.  Shortly after installing the doorbell we traveled and were pleasantly surprised to be notified on our phones when the dog sitter arrived!  It has been installed for about 3 weeks and the battery shows at about 84% with reasonable activity.  We are not close to the street so it won't be set off by passing traffic which I heard does drain the battery.  Our router is upstairs and the connection is just fine.  We did have the sensor video free trial while we were away and it was nice to be able to view it afterwards but for us I don't think it's necessary.We work at home and often can't get to the door immediately so the ability to communicate is a great feature. I would say that Ring Video Doorbell works as advertised and we're pleased with its performance.4/5/17 Update: Our Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell continues to perform well.  Although we did not opt for the video cloud feature we have had the product in use since late October 2016 and today when I checked the battery there is still 53% charge left in it from our first use!  We don't have a lot of traffic or activity at the door but enough motion for ins and outs that I thought we'd need to recharge by now.  I recommend having it and we do intend to enable cloud video recording when we do any extended travel.  For $30 per year you can't beat it.","positive"
"Doorbell + 2 way communication +  HD/Nightvision Cam = Yes please!","While rebuilding a home I just purchased in Detroit my main concern was securing the home while it is getting worked on. I saw the Ring commercials in the past & remembered them when it came time to get things in order. I purchased it from Micro Center in Madison Heights Mi & the reps there provided even more insight into it.The installation was simple enough. Charge it fully sync it to your WiFi download the app to your phone and/or computer then screw it into the door frame or position of your choice. 4 screws into the frame 2 screws to tighten the device to the lock frame. No wires & no mess. Took literally about 5-10 min for install from sync to hookup. I am usually skeptical about things proclaiming that installs are very easy but this one really was. Gets a + in my book.Camera is extremely clear day or night sun rain or snow. You can adjust the range of the motion sensor from 30 feet out to any range within and adjust the sensitivity of the motion sensor. You can also add on an in house door chime if you do not have an existing door bell (like me) that syncs with the ring so again no wires OR multiple ring devices for multiple locations and/or homes. It also works very well with my recently installed Xfinity home security. I now have no blind spot.Best part is that the Ring device allows me to see who's coming to my house when I'm not there. It can make people think you are there in the home when you aren't which is another +.  I just had an issue with our local water department claiming a technician had come out to turn on the service in which the tech stated that he knocked on the door but no one was home and that he waited 10 minutes before he left. The ring doorbell clearly showed however that he in fact just walked up to the door did not knock (when the motion sensor is set off it records the audio as well as the video) just hung up the 'sorry we missed you' door hanger and then immediately left. They were trying to charge me a 40.00 missed appointment fee for that but instead thanks to the Ring recording I just simply walked into an office and showed the video. Needless to say that the charges were reversed. I have also caught a Comcast tech pulling up in front of the home sitting there for 5 minutes and then pulling off something else I was able to prove as well. This device is well worth the money invested and I have told/shown my friends. 2 of them have just bought it within the last few days and I am going back on Friday to purchase another for a different house. These devices aloows you to do the impossible - be in 2 or more places at one time! Hope my review helps!","positive"
"Excellent","I love this camera. Ok I have this mounted on top of a 16 ft sign pointed at my front gate. so when someone comes to my gate the motion sensor sends me an alert on my IPhone - Since the camera is connected over my WiFi network I can see who is there Live and talk to them as well as listen to them respond. Sometimes it scares people when they all of a sudden realize their being watched and especially if they hear me talking to them. LOL - What I thought was interesting was that Ring will replace your camera if it gets stolen (imagine that). Regardless the camera is quality built does a good job at night (low light conditions). I power it with a solar panel from Ring and never had an issue with it. I have tried others wireless cameras too however this is the only one that worked in sub zero temps. I'm in Alaska!","positive"
"OUTSTANDING packaging and set up","I've never been so impressed with a delivered product.  This thing was bubble wrapped perfectly. The item itself came with every single thing you need.  Even a mini level it was so cute.  Instructions were easy to follow and it was extremely professional in it's packaging and product.  I was blown away.  I set it up to my wifi through the app.  This is where a problem came in.  Once it was set up and I was testing it in my garage the picture was so blown up and white you could hardly see and my app was not working.  It would spin and freeze up on me which was a major disappointment.  I have a Note 5 so it should be a good enough phone right?  Well my son being an apple junky downloaded the app to his phone and what do you know? The dang thing worked perfectly other than the blown up image.  I was worried I'd have to send it back and debated exchanging it for the pro so I could have a better quality picture.The next day I decided to hook it up first and test it out from there.  It was a simple set up removing my old (actually new since last year) doorbell and hooking the wires to the plate.  I attached the doorbell to the plate and no doorbell.  My son was KIND enough to remind me to turn the power back on. LOL.  Brain fog moment.  I did as he suggested lol (him laughing the whole time) and tried out my new Ring doorbell.  I immediately got an alert and of course my phone would not view it so my son happily showed him the picture from his phone and the clarity was great!  Not blown up like it was in my garage.  I'm assuming that was due to all the lighting.  We were able to talk to each other which was awesome.I also discovered that I could download the app on my windows 10 computer which I immediately did and perfect clarity.  Well my hubby said Christmas was coming early for me and I can upgrade to the new note 8 since this doorbell was super important to me.  I'm often running inside the house to check my door when my rude dogs think every person walking buy is a danger and on our property even if their yards away.  Now I can conveniently check my computer first or my phone which decided to start working after my Christmas gift was revealed of course.I'll still need that 8 because....well....it's got a better camera you know.  lol.  I do have difficulty with the app working at times on all devices as it will sometimes take a while to upload.  I found going straight to live view solves that issue 9 times out of 10.  I can still hit the green phone button to utilize the speakers.  Don't forget to hit the red phone button when your done talking or the UPS guy will still hear your conversation which is kind of embarrassing. LOL.  I learned that the hard way.I wish the clarity were a bit better but having said that I do have solid images and it's really pretty good for the price.  Not sure doubling the price for a hair better quality would be worth it or not.  Maybe later down the road I'll get the upgrade.  I would really love the latest and greatest but nearly $500 made me choke on my saliva.  I'm very happy with my purchase would highly recommend and I no longer have to get the unwanted exercise of running to my front door every time the dog barks.  I will be paying for the cloud service after all we do need it to record or what's the point right?  But 3$ a month is doable.  Don't think I need the 10$ package.P.S.  If I remember (brain fog) I'll try to update when I get my new phone and let you know if the app works better on it or not!  Love the product!","positive"
"Excellent peace of mind! Don't wait. Buy this now!","We installed this at our new house. I knew that going from a single floor condo in a multi-tenant building with a lobby into a two story townhouse would require some adjustments. And particularly concerning answering doors and package delivery.In the first 2 days I realized that I simply wasn't going to drop all of what I (6 months pregnant) was doing to sprint to the door to greet...A generally unexpected guest.Nowadays people call before they show up at your door.  But whomever rings this doorbell is someone that you probably hadn't planned on being there.  This doorbell acts as an incredible alert for the folks who we aren't expecting...Solicitation people at the wrong door kids etc.In the first week that it's been installed I've already avoided having to climb out of bed and down the stairs to open the door for my mom (she unknowingly left the door open). I was able to let her know that the door was actually already open.And while I was at work in D.C. my husband (who was in Denver at the time) and I were both alerted to the fact that a strange guy kept showing up at our door during the day.I was finally able to explain to the stranger that I was unable to answer the door but--most importantly--that he was at the incorrect address. He identified himself as an installer of some sort.But who knows what I thwarted by being able to greet him at the door with my voice. Ring totally gave us the peace of mind in this situation that is very very difficult to satisfy.Worth every single penny... Especially for pregnant people!Thank you!","positive"
"Yes! It Works and Makes Us Feel More Secure.","We were so excited to make this purchase and awaited the delivery. It is built very well came with everything I needed to install it. It says that in the description but I wanted to mention that in my review because it meant so much to me. As the outside of our home is masonry I did use the INCLUDED masonry drill bit. It worked great and this door bell is mounted solid as a rock on my home. I had just learned about video door bells by actually seeing a different brand. I then went to youtube to learn more about the one I saw and realized it only worked by a rechargeable lithium battery and could not install to my existing doorbell wiring. While I was on you tube I then discovered this Ring doorbell and learned about it. I then looked up reviews and read some articles about the different models available. Yes I like to do my research. For my needs....I didn't need any extra face plates the clarity of the video described in all the reviews I read stated the difference in clarity from the 720p to the 1080p was marginal. There are a few other minor differences but for us this Ring Doorbell is awesome.  We've used it for about a week. Our daughter came to our home while I was at work. My mother in law told her I had installed this so she thought she would check it out. I was at work and sure enough I received an alert to my cell phone. There I see my daughter and start conversing with her. I asked her how long was she at the door before she first heard me speak to her? She said about a second or two.  I was so amazed and so pleased. Some evenings I work late and my wife is home alone. Now knowing that she does not have to go to the door to answer it if she is home alone truly makes her and I feel more safe and secure. We highly recommend this product!","positive"
"Definitely worth the money and easy to install","I bought this on a friend's recommendation and couldn't be any happier with the purchase.  Setup was easy and I have wired it to where my doorbell used to be.  It took a couple of tries before the Ring wi-fi SSID showed up.  The door frame is a molding so the back doesn't sit flush to the wood.  I used the included black caulk to fill in the space.  Wiring was no problem and the initial setup was very easy with an iPhone.It's really cool to get an alert on your phone when someone either moves in the motion-sensing area or rings the doorbell.  I know when my kids get home and leave and can even see which kid with the cloud video clips.  I can also see when workers come to the house or if the UPS or USPS guys actually ring the bell when they drop off a package.  So cool.I haven't used the remote talking function much yet outside of a couple of successful tests with the family but the speakers were reasonably audible.Video quality is generally choppy but sharp enough to see who is there.  I could see having to clean off the lens every so often.Battery is maintaining around 77% so not sure how fast the wired doorbell trickle-charging works.  It would be nice to see what kind of voltage is it receiving and the strength of the wifi signal like the Nests' info screen.This would be truly awesome if it played nicely with other home automation apps like Insteon so you could program lights to go on with a ring of the bell without using IFTTT.  I wish I could build a front-end app that would work with the various home automation and music apps (e.g. Sonos receiver-specific apps garage apps) that would integrate everything including macros in one interface.Outside of these wishes the hardware and software solution are easy to use and extremely effective.  This purchase was worth every penny and highly recommended.","positive"
"Ring WIFI Video Doorbell","I had trouble with the first unit but Ring sent me a replacement.  Ring has outstanding service support and stuck right with me until I had it going.  The lens on the camera is a Fish Eye lens that covers a wide angle.  The image is very sharp.  You can adjust how far to set the motion sensor or you can turn it off and just use the door bell button only. You can answer the doorbell from anywhere and have a conversation with the person at the door.  I am very happy with Ring and their video doorbell.It would really be great if you could turn the lens for better coverage if the motion sensor would click in faster to get the face of the person arriving and not their back as they leave the Ring mount should be metal to prevent warping the mount while installing and bending the contacts on the Ring. It would also be helpful if the contact would be replace with spring contact points so the contacts will not bend when installing on the mount. It would also be helpful if the owner could activate the lens anytime they wish.","positive"
"Ring Rules","Our Ring doorbell has been phenomenal over the last year of use.  Because of our friends seeing it in operation when out with my wife and me they have asked me to install them at their homes which I gladly do for free (installation is so simple ANYONE can do it quickly!).  I've installed 7 other door bell units and now am adding a Ring Stick Up Cam to my backyard and setup as well as installation (including the optional solar power option) are as easy as the original doorbell unit.  And I must mention Ring support (both on the phone and on computer chat) is SECOND TO NONE.  Their help personnel know their products are professional and patient and ensure every aspect is resolved.  I wish all help desks were this good!","positive"
"Ring Products Rule A+","I just love the Ring Products. I have a Ring Pro with the Ring Chime Pro for the front of my house wired directly to a Elk Transformer 24v with the power kit v2 and works awesome so I got the Ring Video for the rear of the house looking over the patio pool and canal. I have it wired directly to a Elk Transformer with a resistor so I dont have to worry about charging the battery and a Chime Pro there also. The motion detection on both are awesome. Just love the control of the motion detection settings far better than any other device I ever had. The Neighbors app is awesome to notify other Ring users and the Ring app users of any activity in your area plus Sheriff Office is tied into the app and post any criminal activity. The set up of all their devices are easy and there chat is awesome to help you with any problems. Awesome company with a A+ grade in my book and only gets better. My next item to purchase will be the Floodlight Cam over my garage.]","positive"
"Caution you have to MANUALLY reconnect it to WIFI if it loses connection (and dismount it to do so.. get your toolbox ready)","Okay - this has had great reviews and when this thing works I get it and like it... HOWEVER:  if your internet goes down then comes back up - which happens to us all - this device will not auto-connect itself.  And to reconnect it you have to take out the screws dismount it hit an orange button on the back go to your mobile phone reconnect to it and then hook it back up to wifi.REALLY?  Ring:  come on am I missing something?  WHY?  You really expect your end users to do this every time their internet goes down or their power goes out?Disclaimer:  I have bad internet another story it goes out on average once a week.  It always comes back up but then I have to grab the toolbox and go get RING connected again.  [ sigh ]Would love for RING to tell me that I missed something some button some preference something!!!  If not c'mon RING you gotta gotta fix this.bestNephiUPDATE:  Ring customer service is ABSOLUTELY the best for the way they handled my concerns I am updating this review to 5 stars.  They helped me get things in order and I can only say that if you value being treated with kindness & respect not to mention speaking with a real person who cares about your issues then go with RING!","positive"
"We liked this product so much that I ordered different ring ...","We liked this product so much that I ordered different ring products for the back of the house and garage.  Things that you should be aware of before buying it....This particular item will not show you a live view you need to order the pro for that but still works great on picking up any motion in the area you designate...You may want to order the chime along with this or you will not be able to hear the doorbell if your phone is on silent...  Lastly although you can recharge the battery it seems to lose charge very fast.  I fully charged mine yesterday and just 24 hours later it's already only at 88 percent.  The brochure will tell you the battery will last 6-12 months so i'm finding that hard to believe.  I'm hoping this is due to everyone in my house wanting to test it throughout the day.  The good thing is that you can check your battery life from your phone or computer so you are able to recharge it before it goes dead.  In the pictures I took the night view at 9 pm with very low light in my area.  However when testing it to see what I wanted to do with the interior of the garage it is very hard to see anything when there is low lighting.  The ring packages available are either $10 a month for unlimited Ring connections with a nice deal of a flat $100 for the year or $3 a month per Ring unit or $30 for the year.","positive"
"Read Description on Ring's Web Site Carefully So You Know What You Are Getting.","Then you will not be disappointed.Cons:But common sense should also tell you that you will not have always-on live video if you rely on the battery and do not have a wired installation.For fast response and good quality video you need a STRONG wifi connection. The recommended NETGEAR N300 Wi-Fi Range Extender Essentials Edition (EX2700). Works fine and is inexpensive.You will most likely be wanting to add their cloud storage and the charge is per Ring door or camera device.When the Heat Index is over 100 degrees the Ring seems to have some problems detecting motion . . . since the background is warmer than the person approaching?Plus:While the manual and online help is good it is a complicated device BUT the....Biggest plus is if you have any installation or setup problem call Ring. They will talk you through it. You will get a US based English speaking well trained and friendly technical support person. So forget your ego and save a lot of time and CALL for assistance.Battery operated on a door that gets a lot of Motion triggers per day still has 40% charge after 3.5 months. Other two Rings are at 95% after 1 month and 80% after 2.5 months.It works great with my iPhones.While all phones share the same Ring devices each phone and app installation needs its own Ring account.If you have a problem setting up multiple phones...CALL.I have 3 up and operating fine. 2 needed wifi range extenders not to work but to work excellently.Alert:Buy sold by Amazon or Ring.Trying to save a few $ buying 3rd party might get you a not really new device. I don't mean just open box but a unit someone installed and repackaged and returned.I gave it 5 stars even with those cons because they are all things you should have read about before deciding to buy and most are also just common sense if you think about it. Ring does not slap you in the face to get you to see its limitations but they don't hide them from you either.","positive"
"I wish I had bought this sooner! I LOVE it!","My co-workers were all raving about this product so I decided to try it out too! Our door doesn't have a peep hole or anyway to see who is at the door which has been driving me crazy for 5 years! My husband installed it in about 10 minutes and we had fun testing it out immediately. My only issue is that our doorbell isn't ringing due to a lack of power to the unit which is a bummer. We usually always have our phones with us so that hasn't been a problem. I was surprised how great the camera quality is for the price of this product! The color daytime views and night vision works perfectly with crisp clear images/video. I was shopping at the store when my phone vibrated alerting me someone was at the door I was then able to tell the mail carrier we would pick up the package at the post office- Amazing! The app works well and connects quickly allowing you to talk to visitors with ease. Having the video stored in the app is so nice too if you ever have an issue with a package being stolen! My kids have discovered they can go out and press the button to talk to daddy while he's at work which is a super cute added benefit of this product lol. Highly recommend this product!","positive"
"FANTASTIC","Have had this for a while now.  Perfect in every way.  Salesman have stopped coming up to the door they see the doorbell and walk away not wanting to be on camera i suppose.  Either way - makes my life easier.  After having it about 6 months it quit working so i called customer service and they were wonderful.  They were on the phone with me for about 30 minutes and found out that we had hooked it up wrong and found the battery was not recharging.  They gave us directions how to rectify it we waited 24 hours for a full charge hooked it up correctly and it was fine again... they even called us back the next day to make sure it was working correctly.  Hard to find that type of customer service anymore.  We also got a nice shot of the person stealing packages off our front porch right after it was installed.","positive"
"Setup A Bit Challenging but WELL worth the effort!","When I first set up my Ring device I was frustrated at how poor or even non-functional the video was despite plugging in a router extender less than 8 feet away from the front door!  I called Ring tech support didn't have to wait very long to reach a live American tech support person and was able to learn from her that my bandwidth was seriously lacking even though my Verizon FIOS subscription boasts 75 mbps up AND download speeds.  You have to remember that's hard wired speed.  Wireless is a whole different ballgame.  My wireless signal was barely downloading or uploading at 2 or 3 mbps and my router extender was even worse chugging along at 0.1 mbps to 1.2 mbps.  No WONDER!  I thanked the tech and realized I had another call I needed to make.Getting a hold of a live person at Verizon was more difficult but they determined that my wifi security method ( the old WEP) and another setting in my router choosing compatibility mode over performance mode was seriously throttling my wireless speed.  That and some of the other 21 wireless devices I have running.  Long story short once I reconfigured my router disconnected a couple of wireless devices that I'm not even using and set both the router and range extender to WPA2 encryption upload and download speed on the wireless rose significantly  and the Ring device has been working pretty much flawlessly (see last paragraph) ever since and I am very pleased with it.  I DO have my range extender just about 8 feet away from the device and I cannot stress how important a strong wifi signal is.You can easily test your wireless signal strength by going on a wireless device connected to your wifi and going to a site like http://www.bandwidthplace.com.  I'm in California and the Ring tech suggested I connect to the Washington D.C. server to test my bandwidth availability.  I wound up going from .01 to 1 or 2 mbps from the original test to 10-15 mbps after the Verizon router tweaks and that's more than enough to operate Ring correctly.As far as the whole installation kit goes - very impressive except the little bubble level is rendered all but useless because the mounting plate is made of PVC or some other sort of plastic and the top surface of the plate itself is NOT perfectly straight all the way across.  Use a traditional level if you really want to make sure it's being installed straight.My only other real gripe is being locked into having to subscribe to Ring's Cloud in order to retrieve recorded footage of front door activity.  Not because I find it cost prohibitive but because I find it an invasion of my privacy.  Ring wants to know my exact street address during setup (for reasons that are unclear) and I also fear their cloud being hacked to show someone our daily routine habits...  What time we go for a walk for instance.  I would much prefer the option to store data on my own local computer or FTP server as I do with the rest of my security cameras.I originally gave this product a four star rating due to the lack of the aforementioned local video storage capability but changed it to a five based on the outstanding customer support that I have received from Ring both times I have called in.  I was noticing that when motion was detected I'd receive an alert on my cell phone but there would be no video just a swirling blue circle outline in the middle.  However video WAS being sent to the cloud for recording because I could play back the event and see what took place after the fact.  I just wasn't seeing it in real time.  I called Ring support for the second time this morning to troubleshoot this problem.  I got through within just a minute or two of hold time clearly explained the trouble I was having to the tech and she made some adjustments on her end that fixed the problem remotely.  Now when motion is detected I am notified within a second or two at most with clear video kicking in no more than a second after that.  Now the Ring works PERFECTLY and I am absolutely thrilled.","positive"
"Great for security and convenience.","Amazon should really delete reviews of outdated products. half of the reviews of this item are over 2 years old. The newest one I just purchased and installed this week... May 20 2017.... is really great. It is quick to show the caller very clear view. You can adjust the sensitivity and it notifies you of any activity at your front door as well as you can get a live view whenever you want. I like having the ability to see my front door from remote locations and also see who is there when I am home. Great invention easy installation and my smart phone is getting put to good use. Thanks!","positive"
"Gives you great peace of mind and security knowing who is going and coming to your house.","This is one of those products that really make a difference in your home when it comes to convenience. You can always see if someone is at the door and talk to them.Pros:  1. Really easy to install. Comes with very simple and straight foward instructions and everything you need to install it including a tiny little level to make sure its installed straight.2. You can set it up to pick up motion and notifies you so you can see who's there even when they don't Ring the Ring. Also you can select the sensitivity of the motion activation.  You're also able set up schedules for when you want it active.3. Wide angle lens lets you see more than you would think you could see. Also has good picture at night.Cons 1. The only thing that I would suggest a change is if you're going to drill the holes in bricks. It is very hard to drill the holes exactly where they should be because of the rock  it makes the drill bit jump or move a little and it is hard to fix the hole after that. The way the screw holes are in the bracket it leaves almost no room for errors. I had to drill a hole in the plastic right next to the actual hole to get the screw in . I would suggest making the bottom two holes a bit longer  kind of like an oval in case the holes were not drilled perfect.Overall this is product is awesome and a great value. Gives you great peace of mind and security knowing who is going and coming to your house.","positive"
"Ring is king","Product and packaging was nice (they copied the nest almost exactly).... Products that arrive with screws bits and levels for install will become increasingly more popular. Clear instructions and Awsome app and presentation. Base plate didn't quite go flush on stucco but that's no fault of the product you will just have the screws showing a little from the house. Product works awesome so far. If there is a criticism I would develop a way to mass delete activities..... You'll find that normal traffic in and out of your house will put several motion alerts on your app. Like emails there should be a quick way to mass delete these alerts after they pile up over a few days....... Also don't freak out if your ring doesn't work right out of the box. The battery just isn't charged (this happened to me).... Charge it for 30 min or so you can  set it up (or give it a full charge if you aren't hard wiring into a existing door bell).....  I'm happy","positive"
"Love this video door bell","Love this video door bell. I use it at work because we are a secure site and only let visitors into our facility who have an appointment. So this allows me to see who's at the front door and to speak to them no matter which of the 3 buildings I'm in. I love it!!! While the video image isn't crystal clear it's still a good image. Good enough to see who's at the front door. That's really all I need so I'm happy! When someone rings the bell my mobile phone beeps. It's my work mobile phone so I normally leave it at work at the end of the day. Well one day I accidently took it home and sure enough it beeped because someone was at the front door! I live 15 minutes away from my job but I was still able to see the person at the front door AND talk to them. I couldn't believe the signal was strong enough to reach me at home. Wow I was impressed! Now I want to get one for my home use since I know first hand how amazing it's worked for us at the job.","positive"
"Great product for a little more security... and fun","Great video and motion detection.  I saw a lot of reviews complaining about the motion sensors not picking things up fast enough but I'm amazed at the quality of this and where we have gotten.  While it might be slightly delayed it isn't that bad.  If anything we get a lot of motion sensors because of our contractors working on the house.  But I can easily check to make sure it is someone who is supposed to be there.  I also find it humorous to talk to the family through the doorbell when I am traveling.  Quite funny to see them out there and then think about what the neighbors will say.  Anyway if you are thinking of buying a video/mic doorbell and are okay with it not being 100% perfect because it isn't hard wired to an alarm system or even Ethernet cable then this gadget will totally meet your needs.  The one caveat is that it is on Amazon for $180 and Costco has it for $189 but it includes the chime which usually sells here for another $20-30.","positive"
"Ring Doorbell excellent device for home security","I have had the Ring doorbell for a few weeks now. Here are some observations.Easy to install I was able to  install where my old doorbell was and it does ring our old ringer.  Also bought a second Ringer for upstairs.Works very well good quality video some slight lag but not a problem.Internal battery charged up in a couple hours.  The company estimates the battery will last through 2 encounters per day which they claim is average so 720 encounters.  However my wife and I come in and out our front door all day and each entry or exit creates an encounter so we will likely have to charge the battery more often.  I would love a feature that would somehow allow our Ring doorbell to recognize our phones when we arrive at our own door and not create an encounter.When I first installed Ring I was able to view what was an approximation of the charge left on the battery.  That has since disappeared.As their ad states most home burglaries are initiated by the burglar's attempt to see if anyone is home.  Where we live our homes are all enclosed in fences most 8 foot redwood.  So we installed Yard Lock keyless wood gate locks on both sides (http://www.yardlock.ca/).  These locks require a key code to open the gate yet another hindrance to the home thief.  I think the combination of the Ring and the Yard Locks creates a hostile environment for most home thieves.","positive"
"Life Saver","The lifetime warranty on this doorbell is the real deal. This is a very well-supported doorbell.I was having issues with holiday season package thieves and a non-working wireless doorbell. Ring is the only video doorbell I could find that will work wirelessly. The first one had battery issues. Replaced no problem. The second one had sound issues. Replaced no problem. The third on works FLAWLESSLY. I absolutely love it.The smart motion sensor works well. I see everyone who comes onto my porch but not my neighbors' porches (three doors lined up on one big house). Two way sound is mostly good -> if it's really windy it's hard to hear sometimes. The video is way better than I thought it would be. I can see well enough on my phone but if I download and watch on my computer it is very impressive.I signed up for the cloud recording - it's the least expensive pay service of any of my security cameras and it has been reliable over the few weeks I have been using it. The doorbell is also conspicuous enough to act as a deterrent. I've had a couple of alerts where people looked like they were going to come up the steps and then changed their minds. Both my postal carrier and my UPS driver said that a lot of their stops have these and they really like them.Bottom line: It took a couple of tries but I am one hundred percent happy with this doorbell. If you have an issue use the warranty. It's a real thing.UPDATE: I have a CHIME now as well and it also works beautifully. The Ring Company gave it to me for free as a promotion because I had bought two of their doorbells.","positive"
"CANNOT ACCESS GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES OF ANY KIND","**edited** this device does work well for what it was designed for as a house smart system.

My only caution left is be cautious about getting fire for extensive app use. Many thanks to the rep who gave me  the most enjoyable customer service experience I have had in years.I am leaving my original text below.....To sell a ANDROID device that can't access THE store operated by the primary sources of ANDROID APPS is far too PROPRIETARY.

"Nice Budget Item but don't have sky high expectations","I got two to outfit a part time office I am opening in another city and will use a couple days per week.BUDGET:  So the budget price was a big plus.CONTENTS FAULTY:  The boxes are advertised on the box as containing power cord + vga cord.  One box came with 2 HDMI cables and zero power cables.  This isn't a deal killer you may have too many spares already or they are $7 at an office store.  The other box came with one power cord one vga cord and one HDMI cord more than the box listed.MOUNT:  Be aware these are very simple flat monitors on a very simple budget plastic stand - no fancy height or angle features.  I put them on a paper ream to be a couple inches higher.INPUTS:  They do have a nice triplet set of VGA + DVI + HDMI input sockets.  There is also a standard little audio patch plug but if you drive it off HDMI the audio is built in to the HDMI cable.SPEAKER:  It's quite tinny to the point of being sort of unpleasant.  But there is one.CONTRAST:  The contrast may not be so great - lettering on these monitors looks gray compared to sharp black on my Lenovo Laptop native monitor. It's usable but won't look good compared to a monitor that could easily be double or triple the investment.  If you stop comparing monitors and just use this one your eyes adapt.RESOLUTION: On a Lenovo X1(Gen4) you have two video outputs a standard HDMI and a MiniDisplayPort.  Either offered to drive the monitor up to 1920x1080 with the Lenovo recommended you choose 1600x900.  Also FYI if you have a laptop HDMI and/or a laptop MiniDisplayPort for low cost from Amazon you can get the cable of choice with any other output on the far end (HDMI DisplayPort DVI VGA etc.)","neutral"
"Not great not awful","It works for my purposes (monitor for showing the work schedule) but both that I purchased had a dead pixel out of the box. The plastic leg that people are complaining about is the old model this newer model is removable (in fact it isn't installed out of the box. If you want to use it you snap it on). The Vesa mount works perfectly. People complaining about it not sitting flush simply aren't reading the instructions which clearly state to use the included adapter. If you don't need incredibly high definition or you plan on leaving this turned on until its death like me it is the perfect cheap solution.","neutral"

Grabbed the base I do have and tried to figure out how it fit together.  Well I have four bolt type things but only two holes no problem.

"It's worth the price for sure but i would never pay more money for this product.","First off the first pic advertised is all wrong. The monitor itself looks nothing like that.

"Good monitor for the price but the stand doesn't come off.","Ordered 7 of these monitors. None had dead pixels or flaws. Display is fine.

HOWEVER I can't have it on a stand I need it mounted on an arm or wall mount. Nowhere does it state you can't remove all of the stand easily. It is VERY obvious that I am not the only customer who is dissatisfied with this idiotic design as it states on page 2 of the manual in bold font 3 times the size of all other writing We regret the mounting stand fixture cannot be removed. Since we are an electronics shop the unit didn't cost a lot and we needed it quickly and we are engineers let me tell you that you can remove the stupid stand however you will need to split apart the monitor like a cellphone with the correct tools then remove 2 internal screws to get the thing out of there. Monitor wise it works pretty good but if you  don't want it on the stand and don't have serious engineering skills then don't buy this as it looks very stupid on a standard VESA mounting with a tube sticking out the bottom which fouls the up-down movement.","neutral"

"Breaks easy","I purchased an Apple series 3 Watch 4 months ago which I have been very happy with. Yesterday Ithe outside temp was in the 80’s My Apple Watch overheated on my arm and stopped working. I brought the watch inside my house and left it on the kitchen table to cool down. When the watch had cooled I was putting it on my arm a dropped it on the floor. The screen shattered from the height of my waist. Apple was contacted and the repair cost for my almost new watch with a broken screen was almost the cost of purchasing a new one. Be careful they break easy and repairs are costly.","neutral"

"Not bad not perfect.","This is my second apple watch purchase. My main reason for upgrading was the fact that it's water resistant. Being an independent contractor that part comes in quite handy. And although I'm pretty happy with the watch over allthere's still some quirks  that Apple hasn't ironed out. I still don't get all my alerts. I can hear them on my phone but when I lift the watch to check Itit just shows my home screen with no new alert. That's pretty annoying when I'm in the middle of something at work and have to go to my phone. That's one of the  reasons I purchased this watch in the first place is so I don't have to pull my phone out every 2 seconds to check it.","neutral"
"Great at this price-point but watch for dead pixels.","Upscales beautifully and 4K may not be the revelation that 1080p was but it's tripping my trigger. This TV is fantastic I use it as a PC monitor and the menu is fast and snappy. I do wish it allowed for more granular control over your sound options but turning off the frame engine was a breeze in game mode. The delay seems to be as advertised not top-tier CS:GO good but fine enough for fighting games online which have they're own amount of ms delay. I have the 49-inch version and it's almost too much display almost. I couldn't justify my preferred 43in size with only a 10 dollar difference. Took stars off for the 3 small clusters of dead pixels(thought there was more but that was lint) but at I hadn't even noticed until I was on this white page to write the review.","neutral"
"good budget tv","This is a good budget TV.ProsWe use Roku and it is nice to have it integrated with the TV so you don't have to have an external box.  And the Roku interface is nice and is controlled by the remote.When connected to the computer the screen is very crisp and has high definition/resolution even for gaming.ConsThe product description says this has a 120Hz refresh rate.  I know the industry accepts simulated refresh rates but regardless this doesn't look like120Hz to me.  There is a noticeable flicker when watching sports; and the ESPN ticker line is a little jumpy as it moves across the screenOut of the box a lot of darker scenes appear red - people look like they have a sunburn.  I switched to movie mode and this improved significantly but I don't want to have to to switch modes for the type of show I am watching.The viewing angle is not great.  We have this TV in a corner and everything starts to look fuzzy as you move to the side.I thought about upgrading to something rated higher but after researching I can't find anything that addresses the cons without spending at least twice as much.  So we're keeping this one - I'm happy enough with it.","neutral"
"Great TV but handle with extreme care","Great TV with very decent 4k picture for price. Only complaint is the screen is SO sensitive... Just by taking it out of the box I have permanent pressure marks on the screen.I'm an honest guy so I won't be returning it but TCL needs to think about protective covers or at least make the screen sensitivity much more obvious on the box. Even with due carefulness it was easily damaged. Lots of money wasted.","neutral"
"Great monitor zero customer service.","I love this TV. My biggest concern is that after about one month of use it started displaying a black horizontal lines that travels vertically. It was extremely annoying. I contacted customer service 3 times with no response. So don't count on any customer service- it's non existent. I had to perform a complete factory reset twice to fix the issue (when you perform a factory reset it completely erases ALL settings including subscription services like YouTube Netflix etc.) A massive pain but I still love this TV. Excellent picture quality decent sound and I love the smart aspects. It's just such a shame that their customer service is basically non-existent. Seriously I could not get one single person to respond to my complaints. Otherwise it's great. Still worth the price.","neutral"
"For the value shopper","This TV is ok for a bedroom TV but I certainly wouldn't put it in my living room. I will admit I'm a bit of an Audio/Video snob but I feel this TV is a bit over rated. I didn't buy this TV for the value I just wanted to get a new TV for the bedroom and I wanted to see that the hubbub was about. This replaced an OLD 1080p Panasonic plasma that originally cost 6 times the price or more. This one is certainly brighter and higher resolution but no comparison in overall quality.The TV is bright and crisp but the backlighting is pretty blotchy and uneven. Colors seem to be reasonably accurate. Build quality is ok but not great.The remote is frustrating. If I don't point it directly at the sensor it doesn't work. It's like using a remote with poor batteries no matter how fresh they are.This TV is all about value. For the price point I think you are getting a good deal but it's far from great from a performance perspective.I hate the remote with passion. The poor IR performance is unacceptable in my opinion. I probably wouldn't buy TCL again just because of it.Nevertheless if you are a value shopper this TV is probably one of the best. Just don't buy this thinking it compares well to a serious TV. If it didn't have Roku built in even a cheap Vizio would be a better option.","neutral"
"Great Picture Bad OS","I'd like to preface by saying the TV looks great and having the Roku app is amazing. However it has many problems. Just today the home screen would not display. I would press the home button on the Roku remote and hear the sound but the screen would be black. The Netflix button worked it displayed that app perfectly fine but the home screen was not working. I unplugged the power cord from the TV and that seemed to reset it so for the now the home screen is working again. The fact that nowadays even our TV's are throwing advertisements in our faces without our control is extremely frustrating to me. Part of the reason I got this TV with the Roku was to avoid as many advertisements as possible. For example I changed my theme to something that looked decent and was free ($1.99 for a picture in the background? Really?) but recently my theme was mysteriously changed to a Game of Thrones theme which isn't even in the theme store so it couldn't have been me or anyone else. Additionally there's always an advertisement on the right side of the screen on the home page and you can guess what it was advertising when my theme was magically changed. That being said the quality and size of the screen is outstanding and the personalization settings are very convenient. Overall it's a good deal though I don't agree that Roku is a cable box replacement.","neutral"
"Picture Not Very Good!","I saw this exact TV at a mass merchandiser and thought the picture was great had what we wanted for features so I ordered it off Amazon.  A week after installing and messing with the picture settings  I have to report the picture on this TV is worse than the picture on my 6 year old 1080p Visio.  Very disappointed.  I suggest spending more money and buying better quality than the TCL brand.  I’m still considering returning the TV.","neutral"
"An OK picture  and a semi-smart TV.","Eh - it's OK. Have had it for a few months now. Replaced a 4-yr old LG with failing LEDs. I find the Roku smart part a little constraining - as the Roku OS won't play some media file types (licensing not a technical issue). The TV does show some weird anomalies/pixelation in the dark parts of the picture - no settings I can find gets rid of it completely; and fast motion animation is not particularly clean either So - it's an OK picture and I'd opine a semi-smart TV - I've had a Roku stick for years and it's great for what it is but I'm not sure I'm on board with using it as a smart TV OS. You can't argue with the price though - and I'm done paying $1K for TVs which only last a few years anyway. Maybe I got a clunker - can't say. It works - but you certainly don't step back from it and say wow...","neutral"
"I was looking for a cheap smart TV to hang in the garage and decided on ...","I was looking for a cheap smart TV to hang in the garage and decided on this one. While I was not expecting much for a 400 dollar 4k TV it does work. The picture is ok and upscaling isnt the greatest some claim to have 0 motion lag while i experience ghosting on mine. This TV also has some of the WORST clouding I have ever seen in a TV. Clouding is light bleed or patchiness randomly through out the screen. Its like edge-light bleed but not around the edges. This is most apparent in black scenes where you can see the different light levels showing through the black.All in all its a good TV for 400 bucks and it serves its purpose im pleased at the features available on this model for the price but a little disappointed in the back-light issues. Also the stock picture settings are garbage its set at max over-saturated colors. like it was supposed to be on a bestbuy wall or something the picture was better after i went in and manually tuned it which by the way you have to do for each input.","neutral"
"Included instructions and website help are poor if there are issues  Support is plentiful though.","One out of 3 inputs is working.  The other 2 are not recognized.  I simply replaced an older TCL roku TV so all settings on my devices should be the same.  The devices that are not recognized are xbox one s and a computer.Other issue is the picture seems to have jagged edges on everything like faces etc.Also the edge lit screen is horrible when the logo is on screen and other pictures where the color is uniform like that.I have asked for help from TCL so I will update this as I get new info.In the mean time I can only watch cable since that is the only hdmi input working.Update:(9-4-2018)  TCL support got all the hdmi ports working by dumbing down the connection types to hdmi 2.0 instead of auto.  Only problems are I can not mirror because my screen on my computer either blanks out or goes enlarged so much that only 1/4 of it is showing but magnified to fill the screen.  Also displaying the computer on the 4k tv makes all the items very small.  They tell me I need a 4k display card for the computer.  I am working on that now.  But they also tell me if you want the monitor to produce picture at the same time with the TV then you press choose Duplicate on the Project menu by pressing CTRL and P.  It should prevent the monitor to cut its picture off when connecting the computer to the TV.  (I don't want to tell them about their English)  I have not tried that yet.  In the mean time I have discovered a different issue.  The screen is not very good at being anti glare.  Any light at all reflects on the screen.","neutral"
"Rating is based on that Amazon shipped me a damaged model. TV is very good though and great value.","The TV itself is actually pretty good though I recommend bumping up to the 55 model. It has a better screen material the 55 looks better than the 49 and has better viewing angles. The 49 has one of those soft panels and it's really scary when you wipe the screen to remove dust. It feels cheaply constructed as well lightweight and.... I just don't like the construction of it. The 55 model has none of these issues. It's bigger heavier and the frame is very sturdy as well as the screen seeming to be made of a firmer panel.I would give this 5 stars for the price but the unit I ordered from Amazon came with a cloudy screen with shadows on the top left and a sort of white haze over the right side of the panel and intermittent hot spots and shadows throughout the screen area. I can only assume it was banged up in shipping but I returned it and purchased the 55 model locally to ensure no issues with delivery (and to confirm the one I bought locally has a great screen and no clouding issues so the original 49 TCL I got from Amazon very likely was damaged in transit).Color reproduction is excellent. Black and white levels are essentially perfect right out of the box without adjustment though I recommend setting the screen's mode to normal as it comes default in low power mode. It's amazing how little calibration is needed. The HDR is pretty great. I suppose maybe it's not as good as other TVs but it still looks excellent to me with rich deep blacks and vibrant colors and everything just pops off the screen. Do change the HDR mode from Dark HDR to normal or Bright HDR though to really see it. Dark doesn't do it justice.All the inputs are HDMI 2.x capable at full range (4:4:4) which is great for hooking up a PC for gaming. The input lag on this TV is somewhere between 14.5ms and 15.1ms which is under 1 frame of input latency. There's only one TV on the market with lower input response (LG model) and frankly its image quality isn't as good as the TCL. This is an amazing TV for gaming and even retro games you'd normally play on a CRT have effectively zero input lag with game mode on. It's amazing.All told this TV's probably worth more than it actually costs and so far I'm very happy with with one I purchased locally. I'd be wary of purchasing this online due to the shipping damaged one I got but you can always take the risk and return it if there's a problem I suppose. I just didn't want to wait to receive another hence buying locally (my old TV was already on the fritz so buying a new one and getting a damaged model sucked I wanted a replacement not now but like right now).","neutral"
"An excellent TV for the price you pay.  Fast startup good picture.","Arrived with a dead column. I would totally give it five stars: it's got a clear picture it's fast enough to enjoy on movies or games and it STARTS UP FAST (I never knew how valuable that was before). I would give it five stars if it didn't come with a dead column.Audio gives you lots of options and although you're not going to get good bass or full-range sound out of the built-in speakers you will definitely be impressed with the option to highlight speech (makes it easier to hear dialogue at low volume while the kids are asleep even with other stuff happening in the picture).","neutral"

"Mixed bag if you have smart devices in your home READ THIS it will save you a LOT OF TIME and HEAD ACHES.","I actually purchased the first set of 3 from Best Buy and then purchased this fourth one on Amazon just FYI on my setup I have 4.Pros: its easy to setup seems to be reliable and coverage is VASTLY improved over my Apple Airport Extreme. I like the app with the speed tests and other info like connected devices.Cons: If you have more than one unit you are forced to use NAT on the main unit thus making your entire network a NAT which in many cases causes it to be a sub-NAT if your router is not bridgeable. Mine is not AT&T in their infinite wisdom has no way of doing a pure bridge never a dull moment with AT&T and Comcast ughh.So in my case I was forced to do the DMZ dance with my AT&T modem some of you may know that DMZ is NOT the same as a pure bridge between modem and router and let me explain why.In a pure bridge ALL traffic in and out originated within or from outside is just passed to the Main Google Wi-Fi unit then it handles ALL routing in and out. IN a DMZ ALL ports are pointed to an IP (my Google Wi-Fi main unit) however unlike a pure bridge not all data gets thru like it should.Example # 1My Ryobi garage door opener has an app to open and close it. After I completed setting up my new Mesh network I could not complete the setup of the garage door opener the setup process ALWAYS got stock during the setup process I tried maybe 50 times. For days I thought the GDO was broken I even started an RMA with Ryobi. I decided that it was FAR too coincidental that it stopped working at the same time as I installed the Google Wi-Fi so I installed my old Apple Airport Extreme Wi-Fi and I hooked it directly to my AT& T modem thus bypassing the NAT on the Google Wi-FI and BAM! the install worked and it worked over and over I tried it several times. * Update it working on the Apple Airport Extreme could be because the Ryobi GDO only runs 2.4 Ghz and the Google Mesh was so close to the GDO it forced the GDO to use 5 Ghz Wi-Fi (dumbly) and Google Wi-Fi has no way to hard set 2.4 Ghz on any specific Wi-Fi device. -- OR it could be as originally thought the NAT causing the issue I am just not sure at this point either way this is a problem I did not have prior to installing Google Wi-Fi.Example #2I use D-Link Home smart outlets they offer a scheduling function example turn lights on at 5 PM and off at 11 PM. This scheduling stopped working when I installed the Google Wi-Fi. If I manually turned a light on or off thru the app it always worked but the schedule for all 5 of these devices stopped working completely. I unplugged them reset them over and over and nothing fixed it until I also reset them and put them back on my Apple Airport Extreme that was hooked directly to my AT&T modem BAM the schedule started to work.So the moral of the story is this. If you have smart devices in your house some of those smart devices probably the older ones may not work correctly behind the NAT OR maybe 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi ONLY.Either problem WILL NOT be apparent that it is due to the Google Wi-FI. Basically what I am saying is use basic logic if devices worked before installing Google Wi-Fi and now they don't work or partially work its highly likely due to double NAT (Network Address Translation) OR your devices only use the 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi spectrum and GW is trying to use 5 Ghz on that device.In my opinion Google needs to let users opt out of the NAT on the Google Wi-FI if we want to allow our modems to continue to be the ONLY NAT. Yes I know Google some of the nice app functions like the mesh to mesh speed test won't work right but at least I will be able to open my garage door and turn on my lights.At this point the advantages outweigh the problems and I am moving forward with Google Wi-Fi HOWEVER if I find more surprises I might send it back for a return. I tried the overpriced UB - UNIFI MESH W-Fi system before this and that was really nice but my T-Mobile Wi-Fi calling didn't stay connected on my iPhones when I was home and at the time that problem seemed like a huge problem to me LOL now its not that bad to be honest and that is where I will go back to if Google Wi-FI does not work out. Lets see.To Google I took the time to tell you in detail where your deficiencies are both here in this review and directly to you it is my sincere hope you add a way to turn off the NAT for multiple nodes or figure out why DMZ is not functioning the same as a true bridge and make it work so it does.There are / will be a LOT of customers that have smart devices in their homes that don't understand why suddenly some of their stuff stops working and will just give up and send your devices back. I personally think you could have done a better job being compatible with devices it almost seems like some stubborn decisions were made on your part to force NAT and 5 Ghz on your users Google? Why?Thank YouRob","neutral"
"A Very Good WiFi Mesh Network Solution- and Why I Returned Mine","I wanted better/faster wifi throughout our 2800 square-foot home (which I wired for ethernet years ago- before there was reliable wifi). We have a 100 mbps Verizon FIOS service with their Quantum Gateway Router on the 2nd floor at one end of the house. The ethernet connections were awesome but the WiFi connections were much slower and spottier. I like Google products and heard great things about this set so I tried it out.The units themselves are very nice looking and connecting them was a breeze using the phone app. The wifi coverage was certainly improved and the signal strength was very good in most places in our home.The problems came when trying to connect some of our peripheral devices- IP cameras printers a TV and a few others- which refused to connect. I spent some time researching and troubleshooting but the Amcrest IP cameras whose back-up connectivity troubleshooting required an ethernet connection seemed nearly impossible to configure on the Google WiFi network.It is important to understand that Google WiFi creates its own network- separate from your original ethernet network. So devices hooked-up to the Google WiFi network can't be seen via the Verizon Router interface and vice-versa. This causes big problems with some devices that are difficult to connect to the Google WiFi network but worked fine on the original WiFi and ethernet network. There were some things that could be done by reading hacking around changing device and network settings etc. But it became very time-consuming and a PITA just to get some devices- which ran fine on the old network- to connect at all to the new network. And if you think my situation is an isolated incident check the Google WiFi public help forum or Google something like can't connect printer to Google WiFi. There are a huge number of people with problems- many worse than what I had.I finally decided that the troubleshooting and reconfiguring was more trouble than it was worth and returned the Google Devices. I replaced them with 2 Verizon-branded Actiontec Wireless Network Extenders (see link in the comments to this review). The Actiontec Extenders simply connect via Ethernet to your existing network (there's also a MoCA connection that costs a little more and allows you to connect via your coaxial cable wiring if you don't have ethernet where you want to put the extenders) and then act as access points to the existing network. They required zero configuration nothing had to be re-connected or re-configured as they are simply an extension of what we already had. The WiFi improvement was even better than what the Google WiFi Mesh solution had provided and it was about $100 cheaper to add 2 extenders instead of the 3-unit Google WiFi units.So while I think the Google WiFi is very good it is best for people with simpler needs. If all you have are some smart phones and laptops and maybe a Smart TV Google WiFi will probably work fine for you and provide an elegant improvement to your WiFi network. But if you have lots of other devices like cameras printers locks thermostats smoke detectors or other smart home devices that use WiFi connections you may find yourself frustrated and bleary-eyed trying to get them working with Google WiFi.And if you have Verizon FIOS and some ethernet or coax wiring already in place I strongly suggest saving money and heaps of time simply adding an Actiontec Extender or two (or the Verizon-branded version of the same units).No doubt Google will improve their solution and it will be better and easier to work with in the future but for now if you have lots of different types of devices to connect be aware that you may be in for hours of troubleshooting....","neutral"
"Love it but hate it","I've just bought and setup my Google Wifi system with 3 points.  After years of trying to solve signal issues throughout my house with a series of access points and powerline adapters I thought I'd found my perfect solution.  When I saw the mesh capabilities I was blown away.  This is a product that should be getting five stars.  Instead I'm barely giving it three.  Reason?  Let's look at the pros and cons from my first impression:Pros:1) It's beautiful as well as unobstrusive2) The setup is literally idiot-proof3) The coverage is absolutely awesome!  No deadzones.  The issue of changeover of access points is handled smoothly and without lagCons:This is where I've taken off two stars because it lacks the basic configuration functions of a simple router:1) Your subnet is locked at 192.168.86.xxx.  You can't change it.  You can't configure it to anything else2) THERE IS NO WEB INTERFACE....I repeat NO WEB INTERFACE.  You have to configure your network from a phone or tablet.  Imagine trying to configure an entire network from a phone!3) There is no listing of devices with IPs.  You have to go into each device to see the IP.  Additionally you have to dig to set static IPs.  Again imagine configuring 15 security cameras like that!All in all if you're a neophyte or just interested in getting good coverage around your home with no advanced networking requirements then this product is right for you and you should consider this a five star product.  If however you want to be able to configure your network to your own requirements you are in for a sore disappointment.  My workaround for the lack of a web interface was to install an Android emulator on my PC and install the app.  However the advanced networking functionality is completely absent.So while I love the wifi coverage if you have serious network needs I'd not recommend it for you.","neutral"
"Easy setup easy admin tool just as unstable as any other router though!","Like many others I was hoping this would solve my wifi problems feed world hunger and create lasting peace with my mother-in-law. Maybe my hopes were too high.I was tired of having to constantly reboot my other routers. I tried many... ASUS Netgear Buffalo etc... all of them seemed to need a good kick in the arse fairly periodically and get worse with age. Plus I hated having wifi extensions upstairs and having to switch manually between networks. Bring in Google Wifi.Pros: easy to setup mobile app is easy and simple to use and manage system (maybe too simple) and seamlessly go between any nodes and have it automatically switch you to the best signal.Cons: These still have to be rebooted. Wifi speeds jump all around. One day it'll be great the next day everyone is experiencing slow speeds and I have to reboot the mesh network. With direct connection to a router we have 60 mbps download speeds. With the wifi we're getting around 15. I'm okay with that since that's plenty fast but wish it was solid and consistent like some of the other reviewers experience. Lastly and while the simplicity of setup and the admin mobile app is I also think it's a bit too simple. For many it won't matter as they may never really need to do anything. For me I wish I could set a priority device and have it be permanent. The max you can set is 4 hours. I like to game on my PC and need all the bandwidth I can get so wish I didn't have to do that each and every time. Also wish I could go to any device on the network and simply limit the bandwidth that would be cool. We rent our downstairs out for Airbnb and sometimes our guests decide to download some serious files or something and hog the bandwidth. My only options are to let them use the guest network or cut them off. Anyways those are just wish list items and don't reflect my 3 stars. The 3 star rating is b/c this isn't nearly as stable as I was hoping. I will keep this simply bc they are too expensive to toss and the mesh is nice. I put one unit way out in my shop and now it's nice to get wifi out there when I'm dinking around out there.","neutral"
"easy to set up","This system was incredibly easy to set up. Just plug in the units and download the app. I live in a two story house and I put one in the living room one in the den and one upstairs. the speed is very uneven in many areas. I cannot select a band (2G or 5G) as the router automatically selects what it thinks is the appropriate band for each device. I would like to have the option of assigning devices to certain bands. I have over 700mbps coming into the router but even when my laptop is directly connected to the router the speed drops at least 100mbps and when my laptop is wifi and only two feet from router the speed drops another 150mbps. I have three of these but the speed will drop under 100mbps in adjoining rooms. I have an older house with many walls and I know that slows the speed but I did not think that much. I live chatted with a Google rep and she was very nice and professional but kept she answering questions I did not ask and I finally gave up trying to communicate.","neutral"
"Not the wide ranging coverage advertised","This system has issues. Yes they are pretty. Yes overall simple to setup. But the setup becomes complicated when the units won't connect with each other. My house is small - 1530 Sq feet. The point units - even when only 15 feet away in another room (2 walls between and only one in another case) say the signal is weak. Setup completes but the points get wonky and upon reset they now don't connect. I'm gonna try again but may return if it doesn't seem to be workable. Sad that the reviews from industry pundits was so good yet it doesn't work very well :(.","neutral"
"Wish it worked for us","Seems like a great idea. Sleek design. But I coul not get it fully set up. Kept telling me this error. Tried calling - worthless help center who just kept going  through on screen prompts and had no actual tech background to help me problem solve. Had a techy neighbor who’s an electrician come help me. He couldn’t get it to work. Just before he gave up he thought to swap out the cable. Maybe it was bad. BAM! It worked!! We could finsish set up and the rest was smooth sailing. But then I couldn’t use my laptop. Something was jamming my signal. Called my internet provider who is a small local biz bc I live in a rural area. They came out. We’re getting crazy high pings when they ran some diagnostics. Couldn’t figure it out. Had to hard wire laptop. Cell phones worked fine. They wanted to change the channel but you can’t do that with this system.","neutral"
"wifi is great. Boiled down to my cell phone having an ...","Had some major issue for the first few months troubleshooting back and forth with Google (great tech support by the way) Constant wifi dropping After getting upset with my ISP we found it was not my internet provider but Google home mini and chrome cast were the issue. If those devices were unplugged wifi is great. Boiled down to my cell phone having an old version of google play. But now works great. Still kinda slow compared to my older ASUS router but I have so much more control with these pucks.","neutral"

"Very easy to set up and really nifty design","Very easy to set up and really nifty design.  I love the mesh wifi concept but............I purchased this wifi system because my modem/router is at one end of a 70 foot wide home.  I wanted to get a better wifi signal at the far end of the house and I thought this setup would do the trick.  One the the wifi points needs to be physically connected to the modem as a base unit.  But when I set up the satellite wifi points at the far end of the house I got a message on the app that the signal was less than ideal and I should move the wifi points closer to the base unit preferably within 30 feet.  To make this possible I would have to move and reconnect the modem in the center of the house.  I bought this with the intent of easily boosting my wifi signal but my adjusting to the needs of the system turns out to be much more of a hassle than is worth it in my case.  So I am returning the system and will probably invest in a single router with better range than the unit I have now. When prices come down and range improves I will look at mesh setups again down the road.","neutral"
"No wps so i cannot connect my printer from a distance!","It works good as a wifi router. I am happy about that. But One bad thing is you cannot connect your wireless devices wirelessly like with most routers. Google in its infinite wisdom decided that wps is not safe and therefore did not include it. Personally I would have very much preferred it was included so I could easily connect my printer in the next room by simply pushing the wps button on the router for 3 seconds. Instead of deciding for me like I am a child why not just show a warning on the screen regarding the insecurity and let me proceed as I wish. Personally I have never had anything go wrong because of this wps functionality. disappointed!","neutral"
"They need to fix the problems with AT&T WiFi Calling","I have 6 access points and the wifi is great hand off as I walk around works every time. I have one problem I use AT&T and the Wifi Calling is terrible actually unusable and very disappointing It is apparently a known issue (see Google Product Forums) and I would switch to another mesh option but I am stuck with this investment. I have had to buy a ATT Microcell as the cell service at my house is so poor.","neutral"
"NOT FOR FIOS  customers with Internet AND FIOS TV service.","Not compatible with Verizon or Frontier FIOS  IF you also have their TV Service.  Google Wi-Fi insists on being the router and FIOS TV only works correctly if their router is the primary router. Huge conflicts occur is both are used together.  This should be more prominently listed. (At least I missed it and wasted a Sunday afternoon in frustration.If I ever actually cut the cable or go to another provider I'd buy this again in a heartbeat.Pleasant surprise.  Google tech support is great very quick to answer and very thorough.","neutral"
"Cool but three problems","First off the Ring is very cool. I really like it and many people  that come to my front door (salespeople) know what it is immediately and don't bother me. There are three problems however one very serious (in my opinion).1 - The motion function engages when people are walking away not when they walk up. MANY of my videos are of people's backsides. I don't know if this is a software issue or what.  Tried increasing the sensitivity to the point where I was grabbing cars driving down the street but still only got people leaving my front door. Weird.2 - This kind of goes along with #2. You cannot access the doorbell with security software like Blue Iriset.al. Now I get that they want to sell you their Cloud service and I'm ok with $30 / year to have an off-site backup. But if you could link the doorbell into your security system you would have an actual video of everything in your possession and you could access it from any computer in the world. That would be REALLY handy for police investigations and any legal hassles that may come your way.3 - If you do not answer the alert fast enough you are locked out-- even though someone is standing at your front door. You cannot turn on the camera from your phone or tablet. If someone is there and you do not have an ACCEPT button on the screen there is just no way to  see or talk to them. This is obviously a software flaw. You should always be able to wake a camera remotely and talk to a person at your front door. Or maybe you just want to see the view outside your front door. You should be able to access the camera / microphone and enjoy your front yard.Hopefully these issues will be addressed in the future.Update 1/24/16 - I have found a fantastic use for the Ring Doorbell and Chime. My mother-in-law now in her 90s lives by herself. She has become hard-of-hearing and often does not hear the doorbell. By installing the Ring on her door she now is bothered much less (solicitors tend to recognize it and don't seem to like it) and when someone rings the bell the Chime placed by her favorite chair gives her a better chance of hearing someone at the door.I think the Chime would be MUCH improved if it had an ultra-brite LED on top (that you could turn on or off) that would flash when the bell rings. In addition I REALLY like that I now know when people come to her door and I can talk to them before she answers the door. It gives me a much stronger sense of security for her.Update 3/24/16 - Ring has added “Live View” to their feature set. It allows you to access your Ring Doorbell any time you wish. This solves the problem with #3 as long as you are not on battery power. Obviously it also lets you “dial in” any time you wish to check out your front or back yard (where ever your doorbell is). This is a feature that I like as every once in a while I just like to see if its raining or foggy at the house.","neutral"
"Works as advertised but not a substitute to a security cam","The product works as advertised. I have installed several of these at friends and family homes. For this product recording is activated ONLY based on motion detection. But in practical usage its usefulness varies.Attached video demonstrates a shortcoming where there is a delay when the recording started after the motion was detected. Due to this delay the face of the thief is not recorded. Because of this we had to recommend one install a security cam which has always live cloud recording. This helps in identifying the culprits. None the less Ring Doorbell helps in confirming the theft recorded in other security cam.Another practical issue is that a strong wifi signal is key for this product to work properly. If the wifi signal drops below -50dBm the notifications are delayed or never received. At some locations I had install wifi extenders or mount the Ring Doorbell at different location where signals were strong. This can also vary depending on the number of wifi signals that may interfere with speed of notifications.","neutral"
"Great product ... when it works","When it works it's really cool. The video and audio quality are good and the interfaces easy to use. The online record is easy to access via the phone or web. We can see who came. We have a recording of one oddball coming to the door that I'm happy to have to provide police in case something bad happens. We've been able to confirm that some commitments people have made were actually met. However it often fails to detect motion even when someone has passed right in front of it. There are times when we'll come and go right past it and it will capture nothing. We're probably averaging about a 75% success rate currently. Yes yes we've tried changing the settings and re-testing - between 5 and 10 times. At some point it just gets old. The more devices I buy the more time I spend taking care of them and the less time I have for anything else. After a while I think maybe I exist to serve them and not the other way around. I don't regret this purchase but I'm conflicted about recommending it.","neutral"
"spend the extra money for the new model.","I wish I would have spent the extra money for the newer model. My main issue is that the motion will pick up cars driving by on the street 20 yards away but hardly ever get people walking on the sidewalk just feet from my door and sometimes I will even get up to the second step of my doorstep only a couple feet from the thing and do a dance and it literally wont get it till I am within a foot of the doorbell.These issues are intermittent and that's the annoying thing. At one point I had it dialed in to not get the cars on the parking lot but then it would only ever get people if they were literally knocking on the door already and I don't mean the delay I mean you could stand there for as long as you want but till you are right up near the door it wont sense you. Then I dialed it out and eliminated the whole middle section and that helped with the cars. but because the leftover motion zone was so limited it would only capture people once they were already past my door. (I live in a townhome and there is a main walk about 7 feet from my front door).The motion response time and even the doorbell ring time is so delayed that I will almost always get just the back of people as they go away even watching the videos after. I know part of it is that my situation isn't perfect for this being that it only takes a couple seconds to be out of vew of my door and then knocking on it but still I wish that at least the time from motion to recording was faster cause then I could at least watch the after videos to see what happened.Like mentioned before the main thing that bugs me is I have the motion settings set to only about 10 feet but they wont get the sidewalk 7 feet away and only get the road 20-30 yards away every time.My other issue is that this thing is massive. I suppose that may be helpful as a deterrent but still its a bit of an eyesore up on my porch.This is still a pretty good product and I feel safer having it on my door but I wish I would have just spent the extra money fro the upgraded model.","neutral"
"Excellent idea poor execution.","This doorbell has MAJOR flaws. I love the idea of it but hate the execution. I will list the problems I've discovered in the couple weeks I've owned it below.1. The motion sensing feature detects heat not actual motion. It fails miserably as it does not alert to a 4000lb vehicle entering or leaving the driveway(within the manufactures 30ft effective range) but detects a landscaper 100ft away. It will VERY frequently miss people walking up to the door with no reproducible reason why. Sometimes it will detect sometimes it won't. Day or night doesn't matter it will very inconsistently detect motion many times missing it altogether. Sometimes when someone comes up and rings the doorbell it literally doesn't record or detect any motion until the doorbell has already been rung. Meaning they were able to walk for 30 feet all the way to my door passing my cars passing my garages passing my courtyard and still nothing until they've pushed the doorbell.2. I've had instances where I've received alerts but they didn't save in the cloud recording history. Or when I've received alerts and I've attempted to answer them/view the alert on my phone it wouldn't load the live video of whatever set off my motion or allow me to answer when someone rang the doorbell. Again like the motion sensing capability very inconsistent at actually allowing you to receive or answer notifications or actually storing motion from when the motion first happens. Many times I will try to play a video from a motion alert only to see a car that was in front of my house leaving but not the activity of them being there. They really should have it constantly recording and after each motion detection store 10 seconds before and after to ensure nothing is missed.3. Trying to get a lot of the customer service is rough. You will be on hold for ever. I've been on hold for 40 mins straight only to be disconnected. Multiple times it's been longer then 30 mins. A call to customer service had me on the phone with a level 1 rep for over an hour to no avail only to be told that a level 2 rep would have to call me the next day...and days went by and the call never came. I then reached out to customer service again and I found out the reason I never got a call was because it was canceled because the level 2 reps thought it wasn't an issue they needed to resolve and that level 1 should've handled it so instead of having level 1 handle it they just canceled my ticket. The people I did actually speak to in customer service were excellent.The reason I'm giving them a 3 star rating is BECAUSE the Ring Pro is now available and it is supposed to fix many pitfalls of this version. It isn't a replacement to the Ring it's a more expensive($250 instead of $199) and better version with 1080p instead of 720 it takes photos every second or so and thats how it detects movement instead of with heat. It should be more accurate. It also has much more adjustability of motion zones. I have a pro on order and I'm looking forward to trying that instead. I love the idea but the execution is poor on this version. Hopefully the Pro will eliminate these problems and work as intended. Customer service did help me out as much as they could because it was purchased at Amazon they couldn't accept it as a return but did everything in their power to keep me as a customer which I really appreciated. I suspect they are going through some growing pains as they have really expanded quickly in a short time seems like they are working on improving everything. Overall It's a must have for every home...IF it works properly! Maybe mine was just a defective item? I hope so because these 4 holes I drilled into my brand new homes door frame to mount this doorbell aren't going to be in vain!!!!! LOL. The new pro should be here any day now!","neutral"
"Ring Wi-Fi enabledVideo Doorbell","The concept of this product  being able to answer your door when  you are not home or tied up appealed to me  and so I ordered it.  Here is what I found when I installed it:  1.  You need to know that this unit will NOT function without INTERNET connectivity!!!!  No you cannot connect to the device via your home network.  No you cannot view video direct from the camera.  No the device is not usable unless you create an account on the company servers.  2.  Some of the problems that the above limitation causes are the following:  A.  Because you connect to this device from your phone via an app that requires the use of a company server there is a considerable delay from the time someone activates the button or trips the sensors (if you have them turned on) to the time the app on your phone goes off.  Depending upon conditions on the Internet and the state of the company's servers this can be 15 seconds to 2 minutes.  In that amount of time people may wait or they may leave.  If they are dropping off a package and you have the sensors activate the effect is all you get is a picture of them leaving or no picture at all.  B.  The company's servers have been off line several times.  During that time your product is non-functional and the app on your phone will tell you that YOU have a problem with the Internet even though the real problem is that the company is offline.  How do I know this?  Because I can connect to e-mail web pages IM etc. wihtout problems and only this app will not work.  C.  If you are trying to answer from a remote location which I have tried several times there can be a long delay between when people say something to you and when you hear a response.  3.  If you have this unit also connected to your door bell that door bell may or may not work when people press the button.  Apparently you can press it lightly and the light on the button activates as well as the app but it does NOT ring your interior door bell.  To ring the door bell requires the user to fully push and hold the button down for a couple of seconds!!!  4.  Viewing videos is a bit of problem on a phone since you do NOT get a large image and you cannot zoom into see detail!!!!  What you see is what you get and that is not all that great if you are trying to identify who is at your door.  Especially if there is a theft involved!!  5.  They have improved one thing.  Originally you could not view live video on demand.  You can do that now but do NOT expect instant video!!  It can take several seconds for the connection to come up since you are linking from the unit to the company servers back to your network then to the app on your phone.  AgainNO zoom feature.  6.  The light sensitivity is decent and with normal porch lights on at night you get a decent picture.  This is basically a pin hole sense so you get a round image much like the original picture tubes on the first televisions if you are old enough to remember that or have visited a museum on such things.I really like the concept but think that the company needs to make some changes.  Specifically they need to make this a stand alone system that does NOT require their server to work!!  You should be able to just link back to your home network through your router to the device.  I can understand having an option of using the company if you want so that you can have stored video offline but that should NOT be a functional requirement of the device to work.  As I have seen too many times the device is useless at home because the company servers are down have an issue or there is a problem with traffic on the Internet.  if it ran on your home network none of the above would be an issue when you re at home!!!!","neutral"

The effect is you cannot make changes if you're out of town.If you only need one doorbell at one property they're still a pretty good deal but if you have multiple properties the cloud storage fee becomes prohibitive.

"Easy setup doorbell feature works well motion detector not so much","I’ve been wanting a video doorbell for the longest time primarily for the ability to interact with the person at the door when I’m not at home. I don’t have hard wiring for a doorbell so when I saw that you can buy a Ring chime that serves as the actual bell (separately from your phone) I decided it was time to take the plunge. I actually didn’t know the gadget also works as a motion sensor. That *should* come in handy - I can see who’s about to ring my doorbell and decide if I want to answer before the bell even rings. It doesn't work that well though (details below).Setup was super easy. Charge the bell pair it with the Wi-Fi put a few screws in the bracket slip the bell housing into place on the bracket and done. (Setup for the Ring chime was also very simple and they paired very easily.)The doorbell function works well. You have a choice of chime noises and other settings. This app doesn't work well on my office Wi-Fi but that's an issue with the VPN and not Ring. I do get a notification that the doorbell is ringing but I can't quickly load the video feed to see who's there and respond. In all other settings this works fine.I had to play with the motion field settings so I don’t get notified every time a car drives by. I still get a couple of notifications that don’t seem to be caused by anything in particular - and sometimes when a car drives by. I also notice that the video function doesn’t seem always kick in immediately so a quick delivery for example may not be recorded until the person is walking *away* from my door. Sometimes deliveries aren't detected at all. I do see cars when they pull up in my driveway which is good. I recently was out of town for a few days and the Ring didn't detect my petsitter's comings and goings at all.Still the best feature as far as I’m concerned is that I don’t have to be in my house to respond to the person ringing the doorbell. I can be in my back yard (where I wouldn’t normally hear the bell) I can be walking my dog a few blocks away I can be a thousand miles away and I can still answer my doorbell and tell the person I can’t come to the door right now (or maybe “be right there…” or “I’m not joining your church!”). The video function definitely works best if you’re on a Wi-Fi network but I do immediately get the notification that someone is at the door even if I can’t tune the video in quickly.","neutral"
"Solid MEH","I really wanted to like this better--it offered the features I wanted especially motion detection for a price I was willing to pay.And I don't mind a $3. a month charge for video cloud storage it would be worth it for peace of mind if something like a break in were to happen.First the good:1) The picture and video are excellent--nice detailed panoramic view from the doorbell's prospective.2) Night vision is excellent too great picture quality in the blackest of night.3) Great price for the features now that it sells for under $100.Ok now the bad and for me it's a deal breaker:1) There is no on/off app or button.  So if you are in and out of the house much or have kids or any other commotion in front of the doorbell the motion detector will be CONSTANTLY be in use. Sure you can use an app to silence any alerts to motion.  But that's not going to stop the doorbell from recording that motion.2) Because of not being able to turn it off and the constant use your doorbell will completely discharge it's internal battery within 2 days time and it will NOT matter whether doorbell is hardwired or not.  In fact it will discharge even sooner if on battery alone.  And a discharged battery will not recover on it's on just by being hardwired (ex it took the hard wiring 3 days of recharging to recover 20% of it's charge).3) Customer service is not.  You will wait forever and not talk to anyone and they will not call you back.  Best to hit a button for something like ordering only then will you get a person on the other end that can tell you we're working on an app to turn it on and off.Here's the solution for turning the motion on and off.  It's the only reason it hasn't been returned (yet).You have to reduce the motion fields to zero then push the doorbell button to set. It works most of the time.What a hassle!Missing an on/off app clearly means it's still not ready for prime time.  And its been out for 2 years!UPDATE:It stopped working altogether 3 months after use.  Ring is sending a replacement 1 year warranty.  If you call them do not select option trouble shooting / help with device; those calls they do not answer and you will be on hold for the rest of your life.  Select sales option those calls get answered : )","neutral"
"Nice camera but watch out for fees!","We had a few problems getting it setup so that the app and our normal doorbell worked simultaneously. Once we got it figured out I really liked this product. I really like how videos are stored on the app for rings and/motion. My main complaint is that after the first month the videos are no longer available and you have to pay a monthly or yearly fee to access the videos. This is ridiculous considering how much the doorbell costs!","neutral"
"Okay - but a fatal flaw (for me)  if you're using it at a different location and it needs to be reset.","I purchased two of these for two homes in two different states.  When they work - they are great and do what they are supposed to do.  The problem is there are some issues about how they work and if you are using this at a location where you are not physically present they are actually pretty horrible.For some reason a short time after the second doorbell was added to my account both devices went offline from my app.  The doorbell would still ring and was still connected to the wifi but the app itself saw them as offline so no live view no activity no anything.  I contacted tech support via chat.  It's nice that they are available 24/7 and we were able to get the doorbell in my current location back up and running by doing a complete reset and re adding it.  The problem is - and it's really a fatal flaw for me - is the device at my other home about 1000 miles away can't be brought back online until I am there in person to take it off and press the orange button for 15 seconds.If the cable company can figure out how to remotely reset a cable box you think the same could be done with a doorbell.  So now I am not capturing any video at my other home.  I don't know if anyone is there and I am basically back having an ordinary but expensive doorbell that doesn't do anything but ring.  It will be this way until I travel there and push that button for 15 seconds (after removing the doorbell which is also kind of a paint).  Really quite unacceptable.  Luckily my ADT security system is working fine and I'm not worried from a security standpoint but kind of disappointed in purchasing a device that seems to go off line from time to time and can't be reset until you are there in person.  Will probably return these and look for other options.","neutral"
"Early review.  Having issues","I'll revise or extend my review if things change.First the packaging is exceptional.  Very nicely done.  Instructions are good.  When I installed the doorbell and two chime units it all worked.  It took a bit of trial and error but eventually it all worked.  I was happy.But it's now having issues:1.  It's hardwired.  At first it was ringing our hallway doorbell just as billed.  But for some reason it quit doing that.  Hallway existing doorbell has been silent for 3 days. I've tested a lot.  The hallway doorbell certainly works I can remove the Ring and connect the two terminals underneath and the doorbell rings like it used to.  But the Ring has quit actuating the doorbell.  Yes the diode is installed and oriented properly.  I checked the diode with my VOM it's working.  Something happened after about 2 days of installation and Ring quit ringing the hallway doorbell.2.  Motion Alerts falsing.  In fact every motion alert (between 15 and 25 a day) are all false.  I've reduced the motion alert to 3' but it still falses.  I'll probably turn that feature off.3.  My Ring app shows a whole slew of events but they cannot be deleted.  In fact they don't exist in the cloud and that's why they cannot be deleted in my app.  They've escalated my trouble call to the next level.  I think there may be a bug in the app that deletes the events at their cloud site but under certain circumstances leaves them on the app.I'm really anxious to having my Ring work properly and am looking on the Internet for help.  When the problems are resolved I'll update my review.","neutral"
"I Wish We Had Known Before We Bought","We really wanted to love our Ring doorbell. We really did. It was miserable to install. First off it wouldn't work with the chime we had so we bought a new chime. Guess what? It didn't work with the new chime either. It seems that they want you to spend another $50 to buy their chime. So we did. We bought the one with the wifi extender on it. Glad we did. Apparently our wifi had a hard time passing through the front wall of the house. The one good thing about the install was their customer service. The rep from Ring stayed on the phone with my husband for over an hour before he suggested we go to Home Depot and buy their chime. We did and it works perfectly. Another issue is the motion alerts. Every time we go out our front door we get a motion alert. Not good. So I turned off the sound for those alerts. I still get them in the app (silent) and have to delete them. I'm still trying to figure out how to turn them off altogether but that's another story. I loved the video when someone rang the doorbell. I didn't realize (when I bought the Ring) that I would have to pay $30 a year to Ring to get the videos. So we did pay. Our old doorbell was mounted low and we had to use the same install spot because we have stucco so our Ring is lower than it should be for good video. If you have an Apple watch it will tell you that someone is at your door but the app won't open on my phone. Thus I'm too late to talk to whoever is at the door once I manually open the Ring app. I know it seems like a lot of complaining but I didn't realize my watch would conflict with the phone app or that I would have to buy their chime or that I would have to pay $30 a year for video. So now you know what we didn't know.","neutral"
"I really wanted to like this product and I did","I really wanted to like this product and I did while it lasted. For the first few weeks it worked flawlessly: the image was crisp the response time was really fast and and audio was clear. The proximity feature was useful as well for when the neighbor's dogs would come in the yard I could startle them away. I also lost my screwdriver and the company sent a replacement no hassle. However the problems started about 5 weeks after installation. I removed it to charge and once replaced there was NO audio. SO I could see who was there I just couldn't hear/speak to them. I emailed Ring and all of tried everything they proposed to no avail. I was prepared to live with this since it was still useful as a doorbell. However soon afterward it began giving ghost alerts - ring alerts when no one was at the door. Then finally today it stopped working altogether. It's been about 6 weeks and the thing is dead. I'll be writing these guys today so I'll update here once they reply.A disappointed customer.","neutral"
"Won’t sync with Spectrum WiFi","I installed this video doorbell camera for one of my customers and the hard wired door chime rang continuously. We called Ring and discovered it was not compatible with the door chime. The customer subsequently purchased a Ring wireless chime and it works like a charm. It did take several tries to get the Ring to locate her WiFi signal. I then purchased this model for my daughter’s house but Ring coil not locate her WiFi signal. Apparently Strectrum’s router broadcasts on 2 to 5 gigabytes and Ring only works with 2.4 gigabyte routers.  She is still trying to get this major issue resolved with the cable company. I will revise my rating once the Ring syncs up and begins to work as advertised.","neutral"
"Great idea but.....","This is actually the third unit I purchased. The first two I bought from Costco. I had (different) problems with both & tech support was unable to resolve. I returned both (kudos to Costco) but by then I had 4 holes drilled into my stucco for the Ring mounting plate looks like crap.  FF about a year later and Amazon had a special on the bronze Ring so I decided to try it again. This time it seems to be working great But...be aware that if you do not run this on WiFi only and leave cellular data turned on  (during the video recording trial period) this thing will blow thru your cellular data at an amazing rate (not an issue if you have an unlimited plan I don't). I've asked to have the trial can which they said they'd take care of but it's still running and eating data. Running it on Wifi is ok I guess provided you're never out of a WiFi hotspot when you leave the house and frankly that's not likely. And if it's only on WiFi how useful is it? I got it so I could monitor my front door and deliveries if I'm away from home.....which I can't do unless I'm tethered to a WiFi hotspot...........kinda useless in that case......jury is still out on whether or not I'll keep it..","neutral"
"Good video doorbell - Motion detection doesn't work on homes with stoops","The GOOD: - Video doorbell with battery power allows its use on those areas without wired doorbells. - Good communications and quick response on the phone when doorbell is rung - The software warns you when the battery needs to be recharged.The BAD: - Severe lag in detecting motion and recording it. More often than not a fast moving individual was through the door or out on the sidewalk before the device started recording leaving a video of a blank entrance (see video). - The motion detection appears to be focused straight ahead. On a house with stairs/stoop it does not detect motion until the visitor is right through the door.  Any attempt to extend the range only results in tall vehicles (SUVs trucks etc) being recorded. - While the battery option is great and provides for freedom of location the claim of one year between charges is wildly exaggerated if you use the motion detection feature. Between all the trials to try to get the right motion detection and avoid all the passing cars the bell asked for recharge a month into its first use. - Because the charging port is hidden in the back recharging the battery requires physically unscrewing and removing the device from its location. - Battery charging takes a minimum of five hours.I think that the motion detection issues have been solved with the new Ring Pro (I dislike the term pro. It implies that it is for professional use when it's just a better model). Unfortunately that doesn't do anything for someone who bought the original or who has problems wiring the location.I suppose that the new  Ring Stickup cam with a solar panel could solve the motion detection issue and allow the Ring doorbell to have a much longer battery life but that adds a hefty price tag to your front door. The fact that the pickup cam would require a separate storage plan from Ring does not help matters.I'm waiting to see the reviews for the Zmodo Torch Pro - Smart Door Light and Connected Doorbell.","neutral"
"Need a strong wi-fi signal or pixel city","I recently purchased this item hoping that it was a fix for all of our front door security needs.  The reality is that it works quite well as a doorbell but the motion sensor and battery life leave much to be desired.  This thing is a snap to install.  I had it up and running inside of 10 minutes and that includes drilling the masonry for the mount.  My wireless router is about 10 ft away from the doorbell and we seem to get enough bandwidth for a very clear picture day or night.  When someone rings the doorbell the wide angle lens gives us an excellent view and the voice communication works quite well.  The app is easy to use (except for motion detection protocols) and I have now answered my door from out of state (very cool).The downside of this device is the motion sensor and how frequently false alarms are logged.  Even if I toggle off motion detection alerts all together the device still senses the motion and records it to the cloud.  I live 40 ft from a busy city street and even when set to the lowest detection threshold the device still logs between 10 and 20 false detections per day.  I normally wouldn't mind but I am using the rechargeable battery to power the Ring and these alerts are taking battery life from 10 months (as stated by the manufacturer) to 1.5  months (estimated since I haven't completed the cycle).  I have had this device hooked up for 2 weeks and the battery is down to 55%.You would figure that with all of the false alerts that the motion detector would trigger rather easily when an actual person approaches your door but this is not the case.  My largest issue is the delay between someone coming to your door and the Ring triggering the alert to your phone and recording the incident to the cloud.  When there is actually a person i.e. the mailman I get video of his keister as they are leaving the premises.  This makes this device completely unusable as a security device (unless the police have posterior recognition software).That said I really like the concept and their customer service is fantastic.  Although they couldn't solve the delays now they are working diligently to improve the software and make a better device.  The staff was prompt in returning all correspondence and courteous while working with me to solve these issues.  They even offered to cover return shipping should I wish to return the device.  I decided to keep it so I will update this review as the software is updated and see if the device survives a Colorado winter.","neutral"
"The biggest learning curve is understanding how Alexa pulls information and from where.","There are many bugs in the product that requires correcting so I am happy to hear Amazon say Alexa is always learning. The Bluetooth connection breaks up when connecting to a my Macbookpro Bluetooth speaker. Invocations for Skills do not always work for some developers and Alexa does not pick up on this issue and recommends actions that is not related to the command.  When sending a command to open a radio station on one of the radio channels Alexa does not recognize the command and continuous to open to incorrect station.  Even though I send feedback to the app to indicate that it was the incorrect station I continue to get the same results.  The system is not learning my most frequent commands.  But the sound is great the system is practical for timing and mathematical conversions the list function is GREAT! The biggest learning curve is understanding how Alexa pulls information and from where.  Once you learn the way to structure commands and where it should come from (i.e. Skills Amazon Music...etc.) you can make good use of it. There were basic search engine requests given that Alexa didn't know.  This makes me wonder what search engine or data base is it pulling information from.  There shouldn't be any different between typing in the Google Search Engine and getting a result and asking Alexa a questions and getting a similar result.","neutral"

"Does Not Play “My Briefings” in “Everywhere” Mode","I’m only writing this in hopes that Amazon reads this and makes this change/update to the Amazon Echo Plus. I really love the “Start My Day” feature but I play it in the morning when I’m getting ready and doing my morning routine around my house. I bought 3 echo dots so that I could listen to “Start My Day” throughout the house in multiple rooms while showering eating breakfast getting dressed etc. Except you cannot play “Start My Day” in “everywhere” mode like you can music. Meaning I can play music simultaneously on every Echo in my home but I cannot play “Start My Day” simultaneously on every Echo in my home. This is a really bigger downer for me that makes my Echo’s less valuable to me. I wish amazon would fix this and make an update available because it’s an easy fix seeing as Echo is already capable of playing music in “everywhere” mode. I hope amazon reads it’s customer reviews and makes this change.","neutral"
"Check transformer output voltage","WARNING - If you are replacing an existing doorbell button that is connected to a doorbell transformer you may have a problem.  To perform properly and to keep the built-in battery charged the Ring requires more voltage than most existing transformers provide.  Check the transformer's output voltage first and make sure it puts out AT LEAST 18 volts - 24 volts is better.  Many transformers including ours only put out 10 to 12 volts which IS NOT enough.If you install the Ring and Device Health  does not show 'Hardwired' it is not charging the battery and will quit functioning when the battery runs down.  That is what we experienced so I replaced the transformer with Honeywell AT140A1000 40Va 120V Transformer - 60 Hz. and the problem was solved.","neutral"
"Motion video delay drags down the star rating","I bought this on prime day. Looks pretty good the oiled bronze matches my door hardware. Easy installation the package contains everything you need and directions are clear. I had a hickup in getting the motion sensor to work but finally got it to work after resetting the interior button. What i dont like is the motion sensor video delay. Its great at getting the back of someones head or a car driving away but never captures the motion of the person as the door is approached which is kind of the whole point. It captures if the person stands thete long enough. Also when someone rings the bell and the app is accessed to see who it is it takes a while for the image to load. By this time the person is ringing again knocking or walking away. My internet is pretty fast so im not sure why it takes so long to load. All in all I wont return it (mostly due to the screw holes i now have in my door)but if i had it to do over again i'd pass on this one. Maybe the newer version works better.","neutral"
"Amazing! And then not....","We installed this beautiful device in our soon to be smart home. I was wowed at first. Absolutely amazing device.Setup was easy installation was easy. I loved the alerts on my phone when someone rang and love the motion alerts.I went to work and told someone about it and he said he had one too. He mentioned paying a subscription. A subscription?!!!! What? I researched further and found out I HAVE to sign up for the subscription or the thing is useless!!! (Won’t save video). What good is it if it doesn’t save video? What good is it if you can only see what’s happening now?I looked at the subscription and it is $3 a month. Not bad one might say. It is absolutely bad when you have a smart home (as most people are doing now!)Imagine if each smart device charged $3 that is free. This is what my home would look like:August smart lock $3Simplisafe $14.99Chamberlain hub $3Arlo cameras $3Ring $3Smart lights $3$29.99 for a smart home per monthThe good thing is ALL of the others have a free option that is still useful.Not ring.","neutral"
"Annoyingly inadequate yet surprisingly useful","I'd actually give this 2.75 stars because there are some major annoyances however it is useful... when it works. First off it is slow to establish a connection and slow to detect motion and alert you. I've had people deliver packages and it didn't notify me even though they're like 18 inches from the doorbell. On the other hand it alerts when the trash trucks drive buy 50 feet away from the house. Or it alerts and I can never figure out why.Sometimes it alerts me and when I try to see the video clip it isn't available on the server. The other day I had to wait over an hour for it to show up. I'm nervous to buy the new version until I feel confident they've addressed these issues. (BTW: My wifi is really good so it isn't to blame).So the good stuff is that I have from time to time had conversations with the person at my door and their surprise was awesome. I also caught someone trying to steal a package -- a 40lb bag of kitty litter believe it or not.I feel like if I could mash the person detection of my Nest cam with the doorbell functionality of this thing it'd be just about perfect.","neutral"
"Fun but Alexa integration is absolutely useless","This review is half negative half positive. Negatives first:I purchased this for my small office on Prime Day along with an Echo Show because ring supposedly integrates with Alexa. The only integration is that when your Chime or your phone alerts you that someone's at the doorbell you can ask Alexa to show the camera. Alexa doesn't tell you that there's movement on the camera or that someone's rung the bell; it will ring/alert on your smartphone app and/or a Ring Chime if you've purchased one but then you have to ask Alexa to show you the camera (Echo Show). If you DO ask her to bring up the camera you still can't talk to the person at the door or allow them to talk to you. I'm not sure I'll ever use that function but it would be nice to have. Tapping the alert on your smartphone automatically brings up the doorbell camera including the speaker so the Alexa integration with this product is pointless.Further after your free trial it only records if you purchase a plan through them. You can still view the camera live but you can't see video of anyone who rang the doorbell while you were away or didn't have alerts turned on. Plans are cheap - I personally only need the basic plan which is $3/month or $30/year and the professional plan is only $10/month or $100/year - but comparing it with other services (such as Arlo which I also use) it's not something that's usually required.For the positives:As far as the product WITHOUT Alexa it's nifty. You use your smartphone to be alerted to motion and/or when someone rings the doorbell and there's an optional chime device that's required if you want it to ring elsewhere than your phone. Do not get this if you expect it to ring through Alexa. If you just need a doorbell camera that can be accessed remotely my experience so far is that this is a pretty decent device.It can be wired into your current wired doorbell or it can be used wirelessly. Our wiring is pretty scary so I've had it on WiFi. I've been testing it by keeping it on and recording almost constantly since the day it arrived and the battery is at 50%. I count that as a positive because not only was it not fully charged when I installed it my only comparison is a set of Arlo security cameras which I've had to charge as often as every two days if there's been high traffic. Installation was easy but looks like it could be more difficult if you're installing into brick or concrete.Overall the statement that it integrates with Alexa is TECHNICALLY true but absolutely pointless. It works well with my iPhone 8 and I just ordered a Chime which I'm excited to try out. I was extremely upset when I first figured out that it didn't work the way the description and reviews seemed to indicate but it's grown on me and been very reliable so far.","neutral"
"Okay but wifi is terrible!","Great overall.  Had a Arlo camera above my front door that worked well but had no doorbell.  Installed this Ring and connected to wifi but wifi signal was poor or ok at times when viewing the app.  Bought the ring chime pro thinking this would help being that it has a wifi extender built in.  Signal improved to Ok but was still at -61 in the app and video was very sketchy.  I have a Xfinity XB3 gateway with 150mbs plan and all other wifi connected devices in my home indoors or outdoors work perfect with full strength signal.  Seems to be that the ring doorbell has a very weak wifi radio and does not do well for me to give this 5 stars.  I purchased a Netgear EX7000 ac1900 wifi extender and it helped a lot on the signal to the ring doorbell returned the chime pro and got the regular chime for indoors.  Signal improved to good with the netgear extender at all times but still convinced that ring products have serious flaws on wifi signal. I am hoping that this will be fixed with a firmware update.  Otherwise I'm going with the new Nest video doorbell.","neutral"
"Good product some flaws and some area for improvement. Over all a nicely integrated unit","ProsIt is a nicely integrated and rugged unit. It detects motion before a person even pushes the button on the bell. It has a configurable detection region which is very nice.

A well designed user appConsHorribly cheap screws to mount the bell with. For this price range I expected at least average screwsDoes not always detect motion. I had a package disappear from my front porch and the bell didn't detect it. A couple times I walked by the bell and it did not catch it.Sometimes video gets garbledAreas of improvementOffer live video. You can only see the video when there is motion or a ringCreate a 10 second pre-motion or pre-ring video. Sometimes when the motion is detected it is too late. Other cameras record a few seconds before the actual motion or ringOffer longer than 40 seconds unanswered videos. The way to fool this bell is to walk by it and then return after 40 secondsOffer local SD card storage for when the video gets garbled due to connection problemsOffer 1080p resolution. Currently it only has 720pOffer a mounting kit that can accommodate angled siding on which the bell may get installedFace recognition for known visitors","neutral"
"Not a Bad Idea But...","Excellent  idea.  However... there is a substantial delay between the person approaching and the camera activating so I normally see the back of whoever is knocking at my door as they leave.  For example my front door is about 40 feet from the road when UPS or FedEx or whoever comes including myself when I park outside I never see the face always see the back.Very frustrating.I contacted tech support and they changed the coverage area and whatever other setting but it did not improve the response.  I asked for a replacement and they sent it right away but nothing changed.  It seems to be a product defect.If you look at the attached video you will see two things:1.-  An initial EXPLOSION OF LIGHT.  This happens every time.2.-  The gardener walking on the RIGHT SIDE of the video as it starts.  However he started working on the LEFT SIDE but the camera did not activate until he walked to the right side.  Talk about a delay.This product is a GREAT concept but executed POORLY.","neutral"
"Great company mediocre product","I've had my Ring Doorbell for nearly 2 years. Overall it's a mediocre product. It's common for notifications to lag so badly that the person rining has come and gone before my apps start ringing. My son's in-home piano teacher has been half-way through a 30 minute lesson before my app decides to let me know he rang the doorbell. On top of that I have it hardwired but it still requires a charged battery to work and when the weather gets too cold the battery won't hold a charge (Ring suggested I upgrade to the Pro which they say doesn't use a battery.)Another major annoyance is motion notifications. It's impossible to make them sensitive enough to pick up deleveries being left on my step yet not notify me of every car that drives by despite the road being 50 feet from the house. I've also begged Ring via social media for a temporary mute feature but they seem uninterested in putting one in their app. When my kids play outside in the driveway I really don't want motion notifications every 10 minutes but also don't want to turn them off entirely and risk forgetting to turn them back on later.On the plus side Ring has been very goid to me on the customer service side. They are very helpful when contacted. They even sent me a free replacement after my 1-year warranty had expired to try to fix the delayed notification issues. I highly appreciate their efforts to work with customers to resolve issues.In the end I think this product is a neat novelty but not reliable enough to depend on it for security. The most useful feature for me has been (when the battery isn't drained) checking the live-view to see if we have packages delivered but any weather-resistant camera should be able to do the same thing.","neutral"
"Good idea but needs more work.","The concept is good but it needs more research and work. Thanks to the RING support that is very helpful and knowledgeable that usually corrects the shortcomings of the unit. The main problem is the communication between the outside unit RING bell and your Wi-Fi router or the modem. I would say in general it works but it's very inconsistent in the accuracy and in the total performance. There are more failures than I would accept to register some motion detections and even when you are notified it only shows the spinning loading ring but no video. I have noticed that if you checked later you could see the recorded motion video around your unit. Another problem is the delay after something happens near your unit and the time you can see the event (about 1 minute or more).I know that all these are because of weak Wi-Fi signals but I use Xfinity cable Internet giving me more than 90 Mbs and even outside near the RING unit there is 30 Mbs speed using their speed calculator that is more than enough to get consistent operation. Now they would say about Wi-Fi obstructions and I might need their Wi-Fi booster specially made for RING devices. However after I read the reviews about this booster I felt it would not make much differences.Let be realistic who does have his/her modem or router next to the outside door? Mine is on the third level of my house but very close to the wall that is on the same side as the RING bell. My smart TV is on the first level and close to the front door however I don't have any problems with weak Wi-Fi and it works fine.Saying all that I still would keep the unit and hoping it might work better. The price of $100 plus you might need their booster that is another $50 is something too much for retiree. If I knew all that before investing in this security device I probably wouldn't buy it.","neutral"
"I HATE this thing","I HATE this thing. It's a great concept and when it works I like it but I've had nothing but problems with it. It worked for about 8 months and then it works sometimes but mostly doesn't. It will go days without recognizing any motion at all and then suddenly alert on every passing vehicle 30 feet away. Then when it does alert my HD video is stuck on black and white. It used to be HD color but sudddenly changed to black and white and there are no settings I can manipulate to change it. So I have a high tech doorbell that sometimes alerts to motion and broadcasts only in black and white.Now all of this would be ok if the company cared and wanted to fix it. But they have by far THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE DEALT WITH.  I've brought the problems to their attention and their only solution is to keep asking me to reset my device. EVERY TIME. The device is clearly defective but all they want to do is keep resetting it. And by the way resetting it is no easy feat. You have to remove the device completely reset it and then reinstall. It's quite the process.I used to really love this thing. I even bought them for gifts for others but since mine has crashed out and dealing with the company is an exercise in futility I now hate it. I cannot in good conscience recommend this thing to anyone. Great concept and great potential but horrible performance and worse customer service.UPDATE:After dealing with customer service they are finally attempting to truely remedy the problem. We'll see how it goes. As I stated when it works I really like it but I need it to work more often.","neutral"
"remote drains batteries out of energy very quickly","The image is very nice and the fact that it is a very small device is even better although it has to satu plugged to power supply all the time or it wont work. I really like that it works almost like an android device with a home button apps and all the features it has. I love that it allows for other things not just video streaming but also simply audio (as in spotify) and general internet research as in a laptop (in the firefox app). On the other hand it keeps sending error codes every 2-3 hours. I see an error screen at least once a day (and I only have the tv turned on for like 5 hours max) and sometimes it sends me back to the home screen without me requesting it. I hate the remote the most. I had spent over 15 dollars buying different brands of batteries because runs them out of energy REALLY fast. I thought it was that I had used cheap batteries but I tried many brands and none seemed to work. Good thing though is that they also have an android/iphone app that works as a remote and I have been using that ever since I decided not to waste my money anymore.So 2/3 stars for the hdmi-connecting small device 1/2 stars for the remote control","neutral"
"Great device horrible HORIBLE internet connection","The user interface is great and it’s very easy to use; however I can not watch a whole movie on netflix without being disconnected from the internet multiple times. Once disconnected you have to go through the whole process of forgetting that network and then re-adding it with your password again. I’m running 120 megs so I should not be having this issue.

"Pros and Cons of Fire TV Stick","Pro: This is the slickest little device I have ever bought.  Tons of apps either already installed or available to install.  Remote is utilitarian but has all of the controls necessary.  Installation was a snap. And it's WiFi rather than IR or Bluetooth which I thought was perfect for my setup.Con: The left right up down buttons wouldn't stop scrolling.  Click - moves one place.  Click - moves one place.  Click - moves 12 places.  Navigating to the correct selection becomes a test of patience.  Google solutions include fresh batteries moving location using supplied dongle resetting calling Amazon for a replacement etc.  I got a refurbished replacement from Amazon same problem.  My equipment other than the TV is in a wiring closet probably 30 feet from my couch with a couple of walls in between.  So the Fire Stick is in the wiring closet remote is on the couch.  Signal is strong in the wiring closet.  I removed Fire Stick and plugged it into back of TV.  Works like a charm.  (Good-bye surround sound.)  My next experiment will be to get a 3 ft. HDMI male-female cable and see if i can re-orient the Fire Stick in the wiring closet to improve communication.  If that doesn't work a 40 ft. HDMI cable from wiring closet to TV (or somewhere closer maybe just overhead in attic but has to be where I can plug the Fire Stick into power) is the next attempted solution.The other issue I had with the remote is that Alexa either wouldn't come up (get the blue bar and wait for the tone) or couldn't understand what I said.  That said it is working better plugged into the back of the TV so it is probably a part of the distance problem.All of the above being said I still think it is a super product and I'm going to continue trying to get it to work the way I want it to.  If any of the above solutions improve my situation I will update this review.","neutral"
"it has potential but not sure if It's worth the money.","I give it  3 stars. I had a goal in mind when purchasing this and that goal is not being met. There is nothing wrong with the fire stick itself but it could work better with the echo and remote. I got this and the echo on a special deal so they came in the same package. I wanted to try the echo. My goal was to talk to the television through Alexa remote and I can but I still have to use the remote when it pulls up what I asked for. It was not hands-free like I thought. Also when I ask for a movie instead of pulling up the movie on Hulu Netflix or one of the other apps I downloaded it always takes me to this purchasing page where I can pay to see the movie I just asked to watch. even if I wanted to pay for a movie I still had a goal to just talk to Alexa without having to press extra buttons. I should be able to say pay now or something. It's pointless to talk to the remote when you still have to end up pressing extra buttons to find the movie because it took you to a paying page when you wanted Hulu or whatever.","neutral"
"and I'm highly disappointed that YouTube will no longer be available on the ...","Just ok. I have to reset it at least once a week. My wi-fi modem sits right underneath it and my smartphone and laptop never have issues with the wi-fi signal. I'm gonna venture to day its the firestick device.Amazon's ongoing war with Google is a bit petty and I'm highly disappointed that YouTube will no longer be available on the Firestick in January 2018 because of this.Other than that I usually only use Netflix. I've experienced some shows randomly starting over or freezing indefinitely. I should probably exchange for a new device. Ah well technology.","neutral"
"Needs improvement in my opinion","The Fire TV Stick works well enough. It does what I need it to do most of the time. Sometimes it does freeze or becomes very slow. I would have rated the Fire TV stick higher if it didn’t have those issues. I have never encountered these issues with my Roku Stick.Also Alexa voice command is also hit or miss. Sometimes it would automatically play a tv show that I tell Alexa to play. Other times it will just navigate to the same exact tv show and I would have to manually click on the show to start it.","neutral"
"Out of Range message","I received the Out of Range message when I 1st attached my Firetv Stick.  I read several remedies on the web but none worked.  I found out my problem was with the video default trying to display 1080p and my older flat screen whose max. resolution is only 720p. I found this out after trouble shooting for several days including returning the FireTV stick and getting another one.  I installed the FireTV stick on another 4K TV and the FireTV stick worked.  On this TV I changed the resolution on the FireTV to 720p and reinstalled on the older 720p TV.  Walla it worked.  The Fire TV stick default should be set at a lower resolution when manufactured or be able to detect and set the max. resolution of the Fire TV Stick to the TV being installed on.  At least a better message should be displayed rather than Out of Range.  Most people as I did would think that message was for the WiFi (router).","neutral"
"Disconnects from the internet a lot- otherwise amazing","Works very well. Very responsive... but I’m having some trouble with it constantly “disconnecting” from the internet. I have to unplug it and plug it back in every night before we turn it on to watch it... not sure if it not meant to be on all the time or what... it’s a little frustrating.Other than that it works very well’Update:: had to take a star away. I bought a second one of these... and this one stops ALL THE TIME! I’m not sure if it’s broken....The first one is totally fine aside from needing to reboot when turning on... but this one? Annoying ..","neutral"
"Could be better","The good: plenty of apps I like the slideshow when you’ve been inactive for a while and it does pretty much what I’ve expected.The bad: We have had to replace our remote twice due to technical issues. Well honestly the first time wasn’t even necessary because it seems like a software issue more than anything which I’m going to go into next because it is pretty frustrating.You can tell the Alexa remote to play something specific on Hulu but you can’t tell Alexa to play something specific on Spotify. Yes you can tell Alexa to OPEN Spotify and then find it otherwise but why shouldn’t it work to tell Alexa to play a particular song or artist or album specifically? I don’t have Amazon music unlimited so whenever I tell Alexa to play something specific it plays a “sample” from them because they want to force you into getting music unlimited? Is that it? It’s annoying. It’s bull. It needs to change and this has been brought up to customer service from us with no results.","neutral"
"Okay Option","I love the options but my fire stick freezes and I have to continually reset it. Especially for movies. There is no customer service that I can find and the troubleshooting doesn't work. I ended up using the apps from my TV. If you don't subscribe to some type of cable most of the videos won't show. Like on WE HBO BET....Etc....If you subscribe to Sling it's redundant of the apps already on the fire stick and my SMART TV like  ABC CBS NBC Etc....Streaming is becoming more difficult. And I didn't break mines...YET","neutral"
"Needs extra cable connector","I got the Fire Stick and tried to install. The HDMI port is in the back of TV. The Fire Stick cable is too short and the stick is still hidden behind the TV. Needed to buy a female to female HDMI connector to hook up Fire Stick to a longer cable. I wish Amazon would have mentioned or offered the option of buying the $4 connector piece right away with the Fire Stick. Now waiting two more days. If your TV is wall mounted or old and the HDMI port or more than 1 inch from the edge of the TV then look for appropriate extension cords and coupling devices. The Fire Stick only works right out of the box if your HDMI port is on the side of your TV. Take measurements before you buy. Also watch for length of power cable you might need an extension there as well. Enjoy the entertainment once it's all hooked up and working.","neutral"
"Good overall but lack of volume control is infuriating","A little about my situation I just have a non-smart TV with 3 HDMI slots.I already have Chromecast 2nd gen stuck to it. It's quite annoying though since it's quite often to lose connection with my phone (unable to pause and control the video). Always have to try to reconnect or something.Figured Fire TV Stick would make my experience better than Chromecast.Remote is great very clean design.Set up was easy. WiFi is pretty standard suffer through the on screen virtual keyboard navigate using the remote.Amazon knows that you bought the product so they just tell you to go to a URL to activate.Hulu was nice enough to provide hulu.com/activate.Netflix you have to quite suffer too entering your password using the remote.I was able to watch some shows easily until I realize that I was not able to change the volume of the video that is playing.Chromecast is able to do this. It does not modify the TV volume but just the volume output somehow. That's what I was expecting from Fire TV Stick.In the end this stick just lasted about 1 hour after I installed it. Ended up returning it due to this.They already have the remote all they needed is just to put the volume control on it and I would have kept it.","neutral"
"Cheap Direct TV Now streaming device","I pretty much purchased this to stream Direct TV Now on my Samsung KS series LED as there is no native or console option for this yet.Adds ‘smart’ features to a dumb tv. It really needs the Ethernet adapter though. Would often stutter wirelessly so the adapter makes a huge improvement (but adds cost). This on a 100 mbps wireless connection. However despite being now hard-lined to my Gigabit switch the audio still often cuts out although video doesn’t seem effected.Remote can be laggy. My Samsung smart tv remote can control the FireTV stick but only about half the time. It’s quirky. But nice when it works.If I had to do it over again I’d probably spend a little more for the Roku Ultra. Compared to the Roku we have at work which is 2x the price of this (but includes the Ethernet jack and a remote you can plug headphones into as well as snappier processor and 4K) the Fire Stick is just a lot slower and laggier.But for a cheap option and for traveling this isn’t a bad device…just a bit frustrating if wireless is not too great but still impressive for it’s low cost and plethora of entertainment and app options.","neutral"
"It gave me a smart TV again BUT......","The FTV Stick is OK but it does lack some functionality. It works with a USB hub and works with external Mouse and Keyboard MicroSD and Flash Drives but does not support a USB HDD (NTFS).The Options/Menu button on the Alexa Voice Remote would not work but Amazon is sending a replacement remote!With a 3 port USB Hub I added a Logitech K400 Plus Keyboard/Touchpad which works well. It also works OK with a USB Flash drive and MicroSD reader all plugged into the USB Hub simultaneously.The biggest disappointment is that it will only recognize a FAT32 formatted hard drive. I reformatted a WD Elements 500GB NTFS drive to FAT32 and it does recognize the entire 500GB but it keeps unmounting the drive. I added external power to the drive but it did not help.The 8GB internal storage is marginal. I only have a few apps loaded and will need additional storage shortly. The Fire TV Box had the SD card slot built in!

"Remote failed prematurely","Had the Amazon Fire TV stick for a year and a half. The original batteries lasted a year--quite impressed! Replaced them when it seemed like the remote was acting funny. Problem went away a couple of weeks later and then last month the problem of hesitation or non-response started again. Replaced batteries again but then the remote stopped working all together. Tried everything recommended online (resetting/restarting FireTV stick re syncing Bluetooth etc.) but the remote is 100% dead. I've had to resort to using an iOS app in place of the remote failure.Now I have a ton of electronics in my home and not a single instance of a remote failure. I've got remotes from electronics dating back to the 1990's that are still working. Even my now aging twelve year old DirecTV DVR remotes are still working just fine. I'm not going to buy a replacement FireTV stick because of shoddy electronics. I'll continue to use the iOS app until it bothers me to a point I'll buy a non-Amazon replacement streamer.The Amazon FireTV stick was great while it lasted (3/2017-8/2018) but I guess the cheap price reflected the cheap quality. Shameful Amazon shameful!","neutral"
"Maybe I'll Like It....-  UPDATE","So far I'm  apparently not smart enough to see the value of this.  It requires subscribing to channels and before you know it they can aggregate more than the cable bill. THIS IS AN UPDATE 1-15-18:  Amazon's warranty on this product is very short.  If you do not plan to buy the extended warranty for just shy of 2 bucks quickly make sure the darn thing works right so you can return it for an exchange or credit.

"I really don't care for the Chinese Plastic smell!","The device works very well.  I like it with the exception of the cheap Chinese plastic smell!  You will find this smell in cheap plastics.  It is very common and I have gotten rid of things before because of this smell.You can really smell it in the box when you take the product out.  My wife who is not familiar with this smell also commented on it...Making matters worse the stick itself is powered and gets warm as it streams video.Otherwise the set up was fairly painless.Silly to loose stars because of the smell of the product?  Well some people are sensitive to it and I and apparently my wife are two of those people..You can type in chinese plastic smell into google and you will find lots of sites dedicated to this problem.You can type in Chinese plastic smell of fire stick and find posts as well.  Some people will try to tell you it is flux in the electronics but they are mistaken.  This is the smell of cheap plastic from China","neutral"
"Interesting.  Worth it.  Jury still out if I will love it.","GREAT price on firestick TV w/ Alexa remote on Prime Day.  Don't regret purchase at that price.  Jury is still out how much I will use it.  Navigation is somewhat slow hoping with time and use I will find shortcuts.  Works fine even with my iffy wifi.  Nice access to things I haven't seen in ages after cutting out cable decades ago.  Easily leads to binge watching :) which may also be why I have used it yet.  (What where did the time go???)  Bought one for my young adult son as well. He hasn't used it yet but has cable and wifi where he lives. Figured it might be useful for him when he moves on to save some money.The Alexa remote is a little disapointing.  It doesn't pull up the shows I know are there yet.  Could be background noise of summer fans but would think it should be able to handle that.I do like the range of shows that I have rarely ever watched but heard of.  Combined with Prime Membership there seems to be a nice range of movies shows and original series to choose from.","neutral"
"It’s ok","I had hoped for more from this. We had multiple connection problems at first. Finally worked them out after reconnecting several times.The most frustrating part is not being able to control it with Alexa. I think you’re suppose to be able to but when connecting an echo or dot it hasn’t ever worked.Using the built in Alexa rarely gets you where you want. If you have more than one profile on Netflix it stops there instead of starting the requested show.It never works to search in Spotify. Very annoying.With hbo go and direct tv apps many times the audio cuts in and out throughout the entire time. For about a second every few minutes.With apps like NBC and another one I can’t think of if you pause it once you play again it will skip a couple times. Several seconds each time.I would recommend Alexa devices and the fire tv is a nice layout but there seems to be some issues. Maybe TVs with it built in are better.","neutral"
"Fire Stick is a nice product but needs some work to make it integrate easily with Amazon Echo.","Typical Streaming device like Roku etc. I bought it to easily integrate with Amazon Echo so I could control with Alexa voice commands. Poor integration for turning TV on and Off and controlling volume. Searching playing pausing all work fine. If you want to control power and volume you have to install a seperate skill and android app called TV Remote. After installing and syncing skill to android app (Registration) Alexa would acknowledge the command but not execute. TV would not turn On or Off.  The instructions are not clear as to the correct commands needed to turn on and turn off. Turn Off  TV or Tell TV remote to turn off my TV (way too long).Chatted with support a couple times with no solution. Obvious that they just follow a script and don't really know how to resolved so the end users  has to fend for themselves. And when they escalate to the next level they ask the same questions again. None of them even mentioned the TV Remote skill and app.Fortunately I have 27 years in the IT field so I have been able to figure out most of the issues with the Smart devices. Can be very time consuming.","neutral"
"Beware - Youtube no longer accessible effective 1/1/18.","Beware - Youtube no longer accessible effective 1/1/18.  I bought this specifically to access Youtube and hopefully some HGTV and Food Channel episodes.  Be aware that effective 1/1/18 the Firestick will NO LONGER be able to access Youtube - it seems Google is in dispute with Amazon and they are yanking any access from any Amazonn device.  As far as HGTV and Food channel episodes you are very limited as to what you can view - perhaps 3 or 4 episodes that stream for free with ads.  If you are a cable subscriber to these channels then you can access anything but why would you then need to through a Firestick?  At least for my usage the Firestick has limited use.","neutral"
"Not quite ready for prime time.","Have been using this item for about 18 months now and can say I like it for the most part. The Alexa voice commands work most of the time for me. The remote is very intuitive. The interface is OK although I would like to have more control over what shows and what doesn't. What really bothers me is I am constantly having to restart the device. Quite a bit of the time when I make a selection the old working circle just keeps spinning and nothing happens. So I restart and everything is fine. Usually have to do this at least once a day sometimes several times a day. My Roku does not have this problem even when running the Prime Video app on it. So seems to be a Fire TV problem. I do like the Recent section. I temporarily start items for a few seconds that I want to watch in the near future then stop them. This puts a shortcut for them in the Recent section making them easy to find instead of trying to find them by scanning my Watchlist. All in all the good slightly outweighs the bad.","neutral"
"It could be better...much better.","I tried to like Fire TV Stick. I really want to like it but it seems to fail at the most mundane tasks that the top two competitors excel at.  It seems that the other streaming services that are not Prime are given the back burner treatment. That is they seem like they are resource starved; archaic slow often non-responsive and even fail to load requiring app restart or sometimes app removal and reinstallation when Fire Stick reboot fails to fix things.  The apps are fine with my previous competitor products even the apps on my smart BluRay player and the Tivo in the bedroom work perfectly. I can even miracast© the apps from phone to TV with no issues...using same Wi -Fi network.  I often cannot get Stick to wake from sleep and have to disconnect power and wait for reboot. More times than not.  Stick complains about Wi-Fi signal when nine (9) feet away from Wi-Fi router and other devices are happy. I am an I.T. pro and set up my network properly and securely monitor my speeds and traffic and keep clean pcs tablets and phone. In addition I live alone so no one is using up bandwidth to cause Stick to be whiny and complaining. When Stick is fussy I check internet speed and there are no issues so I swap over to my HTPC  to watch Hulu CBS All Access or Netflix which are the top three apps that Stick does NOT do well. I loaned out my Rok* to the parents and returned the Appl* TV. Like I said If it isn't Prime it doesn't perform well.  I really wanted Stick to work. Looks like I will be tossing out a mediocre device and retrieving the competition; it too has a voice remote that actually works!.","neutral"
"Meh -- just get the fire TV box or get something else","I love the idea however the implementation is meh at best. Also have the fire TV box (gaming edition) and I think that's about the best compromise for an entertainment smart tv box. this is just going a bit too far unless you have a lesser used TV and just want something cheap to maybe entertain a few kids or for a spare guest bedroom. It's a bit laggy doesn't have a bunch of space and the wifi built into it is sub-par at best.The one thing I will say is I Have the gaming edition amazon fire TV box as my main display box; I thought it came with the standard remote PLUS the gaming controller (I was wrong) but for general purpose use I much prefer the standard remote that is included here (though also included with the non-gaming version of the fire TV box). the gaming controller is good but a tad bit finnicky.what Amazon needs to do is have a good bluetooth keyboard option... that'd be awesome! also use better processors and ram and revamp the entire OS as a whole but thats another subject...","neutral"
"providing ample programming and hi definition streaming to our Vizio smart TV. The only drawback we encountered was","To start off...Amazon sold us this device and refunded the cost to us. The device worked as suggested...providing ample programming and hi definition streaming to our Vizio smart TV. The only drawback we encountered was...use of our fair access allowance on our satellite internet connection. Even after adjusting the resolution of the stream our fair access allowance was literally pouring out of our usage meter. We're trying to be conscientious cord cutters but in an industry that's so profit oriented there's really no good solution for folks who live in rural areas without unlimited internet usage. As a result of using the fire stick we've lost nearly a week of our fair access and will now have to buy more to last until next month. I do want to add that in a world with cable internet or some other variety of unlimited internet access...the Amazon Fire Stick would seem like a nice addition to home entertainment.","neutral"
"Hard to get the batteries in but easy to set up","Compared to my original FireStick this one is failing me. First opening the remote to put the batteries in was not easy. I had to get a flathead screwdriver to move it. Second setting it up was okay and I was happy until day 2 and Day 3 when the stick told me that it can’t access the homepage and other sections except the app section. It needed a upgrade on Day 3 and I was hoping that would help but it didn’t.  I don’t have Alexa and I don’t know if that would help or not.At this moment i would rather have another original firstick then this one. If it continues tomorrow I’ll call Amazon helpdesk and hopefully they’ll be able to fix the issue.","neutral"

It does not work at the University of Vermont. All the networks around me showed up except for the UVM network which was weird and after talking with an Amazon tech and the University tech it was determined that it was not going to work on the school's wireless network. I originally had the Google Chromecast but got the fire stick so that I could connect to my dorm's network. I am very disappointed and I received it as a gift. It works great at home but it will not work in the dorms.","neutral"
"Great when they Work-Read On","Bought my first one for the Master bedroom on Black Friday from Best Buy and like it. Works fine my Son set it up in literally 5 minutes. Bought another one Motherday 2018. Literally had my Son sitting out the house waiting to hook it up in the living room the TV pulled out and ready to go. It was delivered just before 7pm that evening. He knows these fire sticks like the back of his hand and had it working for 5 minutes then remote stopped and he could not pair it up again. I told him to stop messing with it after about 30 minutes and was already on line getting a return shipping label from Amazon. He messed with it for another hour I would guess determined to get it to work then finally he gave up. Kind of upset him that he could not get it working on Mothersday but that is Electronics these days great when they work but with mass production you are bound to get defective ones. Hence just look at all the refurbished re-certified electronics on the market being sold these days. Anyway I had to send it back the next day. I think I will stick with the Roku Streaming Stick Plus in the living room which works just fine that I purchased from Amazon. One of each in the house hold is enough.","neutral"

I had to download the VUE app from the Amazon Store but I couldn't find it.  Luckily this had the voice commands so I found it from there.  Once downloaded it was straight forward to set up.  A bit confusing on how to add favorites.  I had two main complaints:  the sound quality and the guide.  I had the volume up to level 30 and I usually listen at level 10-14.  The commercials popped in and were definitely louder.  As for the guide it was extremely difficult to read.  It should be channels down the left side and the times running horizontally across the screen not the other way around.  I returned it after one day.  Could've lived with the guide issue but not the sound.","neutral"

Fortunately I was able to download the Fire TV app to my smart phone and can use that instead of the remote and I still have the ability to speak into my phone and get the same result. Definitely worth it if you like myself do not have a smart TV.","neutral"

"Can only use premium apps like showtime or HBO if your cable provider allows it - buyer beware","Ok here's the thing.. part of me feels bad for giving it 3 stars.  It gets 3 because you NEED TO CHECK WHAT YOUR PROVIDER ALLOWS if you plan on using apps like HBO or Showtime based on your cable login information.  A lot of providers allow it without issue but as a Charter Spectrum user I was denied access to all of the premium channel apps.. EVEN THOUGH I PAY FOR ALL OF THESE CHANNELS AND CAN DOWNLOAD THE APPS ON MY IPAD.  Charter Spectrum will not let me use them through the Fire Stick..  why is beyond me.  If I had known this I would have not purchased it.The Fire Stick itself works fine.. so it's up to you to determine whether my score applies to you or not.","neutral"
"Good buy but crashes sometimes...","I really like the fire stick and it works pretty good but it tends to crash when I watch two or more episodes in a row and that isn’t fun.I just go back to my smart tv and watch Netflix on it instead of the fire stick but when I am watching a tv show on Hulu it’s sad that I have to restart the episode sometimes.","neutral"
"Without Prime its just not a lot to it","I found the Fire Stick very easy to use and needed the adapter so it would fit behind the TV. I gave it less than 5 stars because the engineers might have known that the space behind flat screens is limited and could have designed the unit in a geometric configuration that would not risk it not fitting and requiring an adapter. Further the content within the Fire Stick is lame without Prime. Most of the content relies on purchase and/or subscription. I am personally trying to cut my cable cord and my smart TV already has a number of built in apps and the capability to download more (ie RedBox). So I rarely use the Fire Stick and have been researching a free streaming app. That is what produced 3 stars. If I were to subscribe to Prime it may be a better tool for me.  If you are planning on buying consider being a Prime member also.","neutral"
"Voice remote does not work like you'd think.","So I see what everyone likes about this fire TV stick.  And it really is amazing  it makes my 4k TV look better then my TV looks without it.  For example it seams to make my TV look brighter and sharper and it seams to work well.  But the reason I am only giving 3 stars is cause the way they make the fire TV stick with voice remote sound.  The way they make this thing sound is u just say what u want and it will find it  but what they are not telling u is that the voice remote will not work when trying to find something to watch on like say Hulu  YouTube ex.

"As a streaming device it works pretty good as a voice search device it is terrible.","Amazon promo implies that with the voice search on this device that viewing will be simplified.

You are still forced to do the one letter at a time search from within those apps.Even using the amazon search it's set up for the device often searches and gives results for music when searching films or pay versions of films when prime options are available.I had the non voice version of the fire stick and thought i would be getting an amazing upgrade by purchasing this. i'd return it but it's not worth the trouble.","neutral"
"I liked the wide variety of choices","I liked the wide variety of choices in one way but not its limitations in another. the superb picture. It is a bit difficult to manage.  The remote doesn't pair completely with echo dot.  It freezes if you pause and resume and the only solution is to restart the device which is inconvenient.  Also it won't easily accept other sources such as Acorn (would not recognize my membership without several hours of trying and retrying) Britbox (would not recognize or accept). I suspect that they wish you to subscribe through Amazon as it is possible to obtain that waywhich seems unethical. On further use I find this device quirky and in some instances obstructive when trying to use media not within the Amazon control.  Therefore it is a limited device and Amazon limits its products in a way that seems to me to be unwise for a larger influence in the media world.  Devices such as Roku are far superior for that reason.","neutral"
"Lack of volume control when Bluetooth speaker connected.","I got a smart tv back in 09: Samsung 1080p without the invasive living room camera/mic.

Side note: these 09 sammy tv's had bad capcitors  on the power supply and I recently installed some new caps.  Tv should continue to work for another ten years.Any way about the fire Tv Stick.  Its ok.  It basically replaces the TV widget from amazon with some additional features like music.  I'm still learning it but I notice there is a problem with bluetooth speakers paired with the FireTv Stick.  Namely there is no volume control.  Its default is LOUD.  I hope they make an update that allows at least fractional volume control.  The TV volume is off course adjustable.","neutral"

This is actually my replacement firestick.Gotta say Amazon has gotten a lot pushier with the sales pitches. I just want to log in watch my movies and listen to my music.

"It's okay","It's the first Fire TV stick I've bought as I've been a Roku user for years but thought I'd give it a try.  I've been reluctant to bring any listening technology into my home (I'm old school grew up in a time when we were warned of big brother which we seem to embrace now) but thought I'd try it.  It's okay but of course is geared towards Amazon and I can't say that I'm over-fond of the choices available through Amazon Prime and in the few years I've had it haven't watched a great deal of content available through them.  When I first set it up I couldn't get any sound on certain channels but simply changed the port and that resolved my problem which is fortunate because my technical abilities are very limited.  I miss certain features of Roku and likely will return to using Roku when this device gives up the ghost.","neutral"
"Not so great in Europe...","I bought this for a trip to Scotland so that we could play some familiar favorites for my son.  Alas I found out the hard way that the shows I had queued up are not playable outside of the US region (or at least not in Europe.)  This also meant that everything I had downloaded onto my phone could not be played which left me in something of a lurch especially on the plane ride home.  Thank God I had downloaded an entire season of Paw Patrol via iTunes that got us through although my son was very sick of the episodes by the end of the trip.In any case because we couldn't access the shows we wanted I didn't even end up opening the box.  I'm sure it's a great product based on the other reviews but because of licensing issues please be advised that based on my experience it won't play the vast majority of Amazon content if you are leaving the US.","neutral"
"Alexa where are you?","Does everything it is supposed to do but the Alexa Voice works only about 10% of the time. Push the button over and over again for the light to come on the screen so you can say a command and when it finally gives you that signal to talk a message comes up on the screen that says she can't understand what you said. It doesn't tell you in her voice only a message comes up on the screen. Very frustrating. So don't expect it to be like the other Amazon Alexa Echo devises you see or is talked about. This remote needs a lot of work. I thought maybe that there could be a setting to adjust but there is not. Get it only for the programs that are already on the stick or to install Kodi not for the Alexa voice. Everything else about the stick is fine.","neutral"
"Fire Stick Issues","Purchased Fire Stick about 30 days ago. Filled 4 out of 5 gigs with apps. Been experiencing issues with videos pausing for 4-5 seconds follow by a white screen. When I hit the Back key the video starts up again at the same location where it stopped.Customer service had tried several things over the phone. Cleared cache and data in the app settings unplugging both power and stick from the. They tried to enter the stick through the net and failed. Next changed the WiFi from 2.4 to 5.0 and tested for the problem. It continues...","neutral"
"Cant open the remote!","Before I comment on the good stuff let's talk about the bad.The bad is the remote control specifically HOW TO OPEN IT to put in batteries. I looked at the instructions and tried pressing in the direction shown- it would not open. I spent 20 minutes on this thinking I must be doing something wrong. I am a 6-0 tall guy with strong hands but I just could not get it to open. Finally my 6 foot 2 son (who is stronger than me and has better eyesight!) said he would do it but no the cover would not budge.At this point I was ready to send the whole thing back.I came back later and saw that my son opened it finally! HOW? Well he went to an internet video which showed that you had to bash the end of the remote down onto a table while pressing the cover just right! This did work but it does not seem to me to be that best way to treat electronics!How can a big company like amazon sell a product like this? Don't they test the product out of the box?Maybe mine was particularly tight but as there are posted videos on this problem it must be more than just me. The funny thing is that once the cover is removed the first time it is easy to get off now. It was almost like it arrived glued in place!The good is that the firestick works quite well and it plays the MLB TV better than my apple tv. The reception is also better than apple TV.","neutral"
"Resets it self while watching a program.","After 2  weeks it started resetting itself to its home page.  I'd have to go through a bunch of clicks to get where I was.  Then it my work for 10 minutes then do It again or May last for a hour or more.  What a pain.UPDATE  With the help of firestick personnel I update my firestick and so far everything is working ok.  I am changing my review to 4 stars.  The only other thing I don't like is no manual to tell how to do thingsUPDATE  It lasted about 2 weeks and started resetting it self again.  Called customer service and after working on it for awhile they had me send it back to repair it.  It seems that it doesn't update itself.After being without TV for a week they said it was fixed and sent it back.  It work great for one day and started resetting it self yet again.  Called customer service again and they told me it must be the HULU app.  I thought if HULU is having a problem with Amazon fire stick then why isn't everyone with HULU having the same problem?  Anyways tired of messing around with it so I went out and bought another fire stick.  It has been around 3 weeks and so far it works good.  I like the fire stick when it works.  Coustmer service is OK.  I beiieve they should have replaced my original stick though with a new one.  Problem would have been solved right away.","neutral"
"The only positive I have to say about the device is it is relatively easy to use and setup and if you only use ...","It supposedly is compatible with the Logitech Harmony Hub I purchased but it is not because the hub requires it to communicate via a bluetooth connection and the Fire Stick doesn't even recognize it's presence. It also is not compatible with my Sennheiser HD 4.40BT bluetooth headphones. The only bluetooth I could get it to recognize was my Ink Wireless bluetooth earbuds.  I even tried holding the devices near the stick and tried various distances. I tried multiple times along with shutting down all other wireless devices but TV which had to be on.  Also YouTube app just goes to a blank screen.  I definitely prefer my Roku box over this. I have the option to use voice commands with my Roku remote and connect my Sennhieser headphones via regular 3.5mm headphone jack.  I also have the option to stream all of my online and smartphone content via my Chromecast and that also has voice control.  The only positive I have to say about the device is it is relatively easy to use and setup and if you only use Amazon services then it might be the right device otherwise I would say Amazon Fire has a long way to go before it could possibly become a replacement.  Amazon shopping and shipping is tops but content devices no go for me.","neutral"
"Whats not to love with FireTV. (Update: When the remote works)","FireTV is great. The FireTV paired with the DirecTV Now Beta which allows cloud DVR capabilities is awesome. We use it in our Bedroom and the quality is great and the reception is good considering my wifi in on the other side of the bedroom wall. The feature set is nice and having Alexa is a great plus!Oh! and don't forget you can take it with you and with DirecTV Now soon to open up the Cloud DVR to all subscribers you can take your shows with you or just watch them on your phone or tablet wherever you happen to be.Update (04/30/2018): While I still like the FireTV the remote no longer works. I have tried to reconnect it (pair) reboot the stick replaced batteries and nothing worked. I have had the FireTV for less than a year and the FireTV app requires I keep my phone by me. My wife hates the remote App and wants the regular remote to work. She is also not happy a replacement is almost as much as a FireTV stick. Very frustrating.","neutral"
"Not perfect but I wouldn't give it up.","Love my Fire Stick but lately the remote stops working quite frequently and the only way to get it working again is to reboot the stick using the fire app on my iPad or phone or remove the batteries and put them back in. Most annoying.That aside I almost don't regret giving up my TV service. There are some channels I had that are not accessible through any app or without paying for a premium subscription through another service like Direct TV Now or Sling and that kind of defeats the purpose of getting rid of the service I had. Overall there should be enough free content available to fill in the void when there's nothing on over-air digital service.It would be nice though if the Available with Prime banner that appears on program icons in the iOS app indicating which movies are available for free through Prime appeared on the icons on the Fire Stick app. It would make for much easier and faster navigation.","neutral"
"Seems good but more complicated than expected.","I got this as a gift because I told someone I wasn't happy with my present streaming options but it appears I will have to wait a bit longer to improve such. Because in trying this out I have to say it looked like it might be good for the very brief moment I had it up and running but it has more limitations due to all the things that need to be plugged in and all the wires that need to be just so. Just for instance I expected it to plug right into my television as a power source and apparently that doesn't really (always?) work (this is why I only had it up and running briefly - after a moment it gave me a message that the television was not a sufficient enough power source and that I would need to plug it into another outlet.). So given I don't feel comfortable plugging yet something else into what is already a pretty taxed outlet while I believe this will likely work well once I rearrange things I would prefer something that doesn't take so much maneuvering to work or to use. I suppose I may update this if and when I get it working for good.","neutral"
"Make sure Fire Stick is compatible!!!","The description should include that the Fire Stick IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SOME Internet Service providers/TV.  I  purchased a new Samsung Smart TV.  I wasted several hours trying to figure out why the Fire Stick wasn't functioning as described.  I finally called Spectrum only to find out it is NOT compatible with the Fire Stick.  It works with Roku.  I recommend you to checki before purchasing if you plan to watch any free TV.  With Spectrum you can log into their App and get free TV.  The fire stick itself is OK.  Although I only used it a few days I DID experience the TV turning itself back on several times as other reviewers have noted.  The remote looks cheap but it works fine.  I really like the voice response with Alexa.****I AM NOT HAPPY THAT I AM A PRIME MEMBER AND HAD TO PAY RETURN SHIPPING ON AN AMAZON PRODUCT***  Doesn't seem right sense the description did not say check for compatibility.","neutral"
"hot/constant connection errors","We've had the fire tv stick for 2 months and it works just okay. I can't say how much of it is our less-than-great internet connection or if it's the fire tv stick overheating and causing constant connection errors. I'm legitimately worried this thing could catch fire (our TV is wall mounted) so we're considering getting the newest Roku. We decided to try the fire stick because of the excellent price point even though we are Roku fans. So I can't really recommend this product at this time. After some googling I saw many people with the same issue of constant connection errors and extremely hot fire stick. Perhaps its a design or software flaw and it's affecting most people.","neutral"
"It is just okay.","I am still trying to work through the issues I have with this casting technology.  I have Amazon Prime on my Ipad and really enjoy the benefits of the programming and the Prime program itself.  But when I got the Fire TV stick I thought that I could smoothly transition my Ipad video viewing to my television.  Well this is not the case.  The Fire stick is a separate entity and does not operate from the Ipad however there is an app that can make your Ipad operate like the stick.  I would have preferred to use that Fire TV stick like I use the Chromecast.  Where I can use the menu on my Ipad to select my viewing choice(s) and cast it to the television.  Now it is way to early for me to critique the Fire TV stick because I am still learning it.  I have the system set up on my bedroom TV.  So I mainly use this system in the evening before bedtime.  So my interest in learning the system is minimal because of the nature of my use.  I have decided to move the system to my kitchen TV where I am more focused.  I will more fully realize the usefulness of the Fire Stick after this task is accomplished.  Until then this system is just okay it is to bad that one cannot just cast the Ipad signal to the TV via the Chromecast.","neutral"
"Can't wait to replace this one","PRO: The picture is very good. The Black Friday price and the delivery were great. Roku is the number one streaming device for good reason. It has all the cool stuff I loved about my Roku stick. The purchase of a TV integrated with Roku seemed like a good idea at the time however…CONS: 1. Slow starts: if you're used to instant-on TV's this might bother you.2. Annoying Remote (it's not the one depicted on the box): If you buy this use the remote control app. The Roku remote (exactly the same as the Roku stick) can be very annoying because of the protruding buttons on the bottom. Just picking up the remote can kick you out of your program and start up one of the channels that occupy those four buttons at the bottom (Netflix Amazon CBS News Sling). Imagine how annoying that can be late at night when all you wanted to do was lower the volume.3. The remote has no numbers so using it to view regular TV can be tricky. Don't put it in a guest room because guests would never figure it out. There is a learning curve.4. This TV replaced a Samsung I used in my home office/bdrm as both a TV and a second monitor for my laptop. This TV will not get the resolution right when I plug in my laptop. It looks so awful it unusable as a monitor.5. Documentation is scant.BOTTOM LINE: I'm replacing this at the next opportunity. Having a hard time trying to figure out whom I might give it to because of the issues with the remote. Till then I'll try using a universal remote to see if it resolves any issue with the Roku remote.","neutral"
"The worst issues are those you can't see.","I have owned this TV for just under three months. Had I posted a review within my first two months of ownership I would probably have given this set five stars. At its price point this television has an incredibly user-friendly UI and a crisp enough image for 720p though I found the image settings to be incredibly lacking. There are plenty of great applications and I keep Netflix Hulu and Prime video at the top of my homepage. However it seems that you get what you pay for in processing power and these issues have become more apparent as time goes on. My unit is situated about two feet from my router with high speed internet. In the beginning streaming through the Netflix or Hulu app was lightning quick. However a few weeks ago my unit began experiencing severe slowdowns. The menu was lagging apps were taking minutes to open and the TV wouldn't even shut off after the power button was pressed. These issues weren't associated with my internet connection but with the operation of the Roku OS. After these slowdowns began video streaming was absolutely crippled. I am unable to watch any media through Netflix Hulu Prime video or Acorn as they will just buffer indefinitely. Streaming is still perfect on a laptop or phone in the same vicinity but the television just can't handle it. After resetting the television wifi and any other possible factors I've come to accept that the smart aspect of this set is irrevocably damaged. While the selling price may be great for a smart TV mine can now only operate as a screen to display offline media and I'm sure that there are many TV's out there that can do the same task at a lower price and higher build quality.","neutral"
"Reasonably price with Netflix issues","I purchased 2 TCL TV's already and I like them overall. If you watch Netflix alot you can forget about this TV and the Roku integration. In both TV's Netflix always kicks you out and then when you uninstall the app to re-install it doesn't install. Some other apps also don't work at times. I was going to get a third TCL TV but after these issues I've reconsidered. For the price its reasonable but with the very faulty Netflix app consider another TV.","neutral"
"one complaint","There is one complaint I have with this tv. When you power it off a bright white light comes on at the bottom of the tv. Why on earth would they design a tv that has a light that is contantly lit when powered off and goes off when powered up? Therefore it is always drawing some power. What a waste of electricity and lights up my bedroom so much I have a hard time falling asleep to this very bright white light.","neutral"
"beware if you use LED bias lighting (and you should)","Have had it for two weeks and and as a TV it works fine.One big problem is that the USB port on the back which I use for powering an OTA antenna and LED bias lighting (a must for watching at night - reduces eye strain and improves apparent contrast for blacker blacks) through a splitter stays powered up far too long after turning off tv.It would have been nice to have 2 USB ports so no splitter is necessary but the bigger problem is that the USB port staying powered up so long.  This means when I'm ready for sleep and turn off the TV the bias lighting stays on for 15 minutes!TCL answered my question by saying the TV goes into standby mode for 15 minutes just in case you want to turn it back on.Even when cold it only takes 5-10 seconds for the TV to boot up and seriously if you turn the TV off by accident 30 second or 1 minute would be plenty of time to turn it back on.By not including a setting to reduce this standby time TCL messed up big time.","neutral"
"OK but problems with restarting. FIxed with factory reset.","Bought this about 2 months ago (April 18 2017. Today is June 21).  Used to be a Roku user but had migrated each room to AppleTV units over the years.  I decided to buy this to replace one of our TVs even though I had no intention of using the Roku features.  I did eventually use them for Amazon Prime TV content though which isn't (yet) supported on AppleTV.Anyways TV worked great for two months.  Last night there was an issue where it would immediately reset after 2-20 seconds of being on.  Sometimes after reset it would show what was coming through my cable box but sometimes it would just cycle again.  I unplugged the TV for a bit to give it some rest but that didn't seem to solve anything.  I ended up messing with it for about an hour before I came to the conclusion that this might be a problem with the Roku software.  I found instructions online for how to do a factory reset (the software method didn't work because the TV would restart before I was able to start a reset through the menus).  THe factory reset is done by holding the tiny black reset button down on the back of the TV for 15 seconds.The TV came on with it's initial setup screen but this time I opted to skip the WiFi/Roku setup and just use it as a dumb TV which is fine for me because I don't use the software anyways.  The TV seems to be working fine now but I will update my review if things change.Three stars due to these software issues. Otherwise happy with the picture quality etc.","neutral"
"Roku tv","The TV itself is good for the price point. The picture is ok. My main issues are with the remote. I wish they'd make a regular remote. They've wasted space on the remote with dedicated buttons for Netflix slingHulu and Starz. They need to get rid of those and add numbers.The remote is very annoying to use. The buttons are so loud when you press them. It's hard to channel surf regular TV. There's no button to go back to previous channel and there are no numbers like on a regular remote.Sometimes buttons don't respond and sometimes they skip ahead.","neutral"
"Not impressed with the picture quality","I went with this one because it was the only 32 model I could find on Amazon that had all the HDMI inputs I needed.  I'm not fond of the integrated smart-TV aspect as I prefer my Roku and other style OTT services to be external boxes.  I can say that I was surprised at the poor quality of the picture as compared to the 2007 32 Samsung that it replaced.  I thought given how old my Samsung was surely newer technology would provide a better picture or at the very least the same quality.  Even though I'm comparing 720p to 720p my old Samsung 32 720p still had a better more detailed picture quality.Otherwise not bad for the price.","neutral"
"3 TVs with the same issue","I bought this TV based on the Wirecutter review and the fact that my older brother owns a larger version by the same company. When I turned my TV on though I noticed that the image does not extend to the edge of the screen on the right and bottom sides to a noticeable degree (about 1 cm see image 1). The weirdest part about this problem is that it is only on two sides of the tv and far too large to just be a purposeful gap. I contacted Amazon for a replacement and the second TV had the same problem (see image 2). I contacted TCL directly and they (without confirming with me through email or over the phone) sent me a third TV (with no information or slip to send back the other one) with the SAME PROBLEM! When I asked TCL what the deal was they simply said if I wanted to send the 3rd TV back I can get a refund. I asked if this is a structural problem with their company and they dodged the question.It is not terribly noticeable and I will give the TV 2 stars because it is decent for my playing games on my PS4 but in the end I am going to go for the refund because on top of this weird issue with the screen gap the picture quality suffers heavily when any fast movement or action happens (my experience watching Netflix). The picture also struggles with scenes with dark shadows. Overall this company seems to not make a very good product I would go elsewhere.Edit: 10 months later I am increasing the item to 3 stars. Once you get over this gap the TV is pretty decent I just think it is falsely advertised including the promotional photographs included on this page. Based on one of the comments below it seems this large gap is by design well it is not a great design at that.","neutral"
"Buyer Beware! **Update**","**Updated** 10/15/17I’m a moron and forget about internet speed being a factor. Games and movies not requiring internet connection for video quality look fairly good. There’s no input lag while gaming and the visuals are way better than expected. It is a “budget” TV so the picture isn’t top end but it’s still an upgrade from my old TV. The 43 inch is nice and big in the living room.I will say the Roku apps aren’t the best and I wind up still using the PS4 to stream things. The input is laggy and clunky. All in all after spending some time with it it is a good TV for the price.Before even finishing the setup I knew there was something off about the picture quality. After watching a few videos on multiple apps and on my PS4 one can obviously tell that the quality of picture is terrible. It’s not anywhere close to 1080p HD. All video and even the roku menu looks awful. Fuzzy lettering pixelation in video and no sharpness at all. Very very disappointed. I plan to try some troubleshooting but I doubt anything will help so I’m definitely returning this for my money back.Please read the negative reviews before buying. All of them exhibit similar issues and I was way more disappointed about this TV than I should be.Amazon should reconsider selling this TV. I would NOT refer anyone to buy this. Save your money and buy an actual brand name.","negative"
"Good TV.  Some apps don't work.","Overall I'm satisfied with the Roku TV.  There are a few apps that don't work on it though.  Slingbox is probably my biggest gripe.  When I called Roku they said they're aware of the problem but there is no known timeline to fix it.","neutral"
"The tv works ok but has a strong electronics smell","The tv works ok but has a strong electronics smell that stinks-up the room. From past experience with other China-made TV's it can take up to several months before the smell dissipates. It seems to be a common problem with TV's made in China. I notice this from many other plastic and rubber products made in China be it tires wetsuits vinyl window shades shower curtains foam pillows other electronic items etc. It makes me wonder if breathing the off-gassing vapors from these items is unhealthy.","neutral"
"Great idea but needa major work","Great picture. Sound is above average for an led and more so for a budget tv. The interface is a game changer! But.... It needs some work. Its buggy. Tons of crashes from different apps. Will freeze and reboot on its own. If you have Direct Now dont expect to use it on this tv as the 1080 models are not compatible. Sling works really well on here minus the crash ans freezing. Great idea just needs work on execution","neutral"
"It's a nice TV- good picture- great deal","First time buying a smart tv with Roku.It's a nice TV- good picture- great deal but the ROKU service/or the TVs ability to maintain a signal is a little sketchy. For example some days I'll be watching Netflix and I'll get bumped out the the TV's main homescreen every 20-30 minutes. I've verified my internet connection is fine so I don't know exactly what the problem is. Also I had purchased a Bigger TCL TV for the living room- and it does the same thing.I will probably not buy another TCL with ROKU.","neutral"
"Get what you pay for","For the price the picture quality is good but don’t expect to be blown away. Was disappointed at first but realized other brands were double or triple the price. If you’re not extra fussy and just need something good this is a great buy but this won’t be the best tv you buy. Perfect for a bedroom or a basement. There’s ads on the main screen which is annoying but you can set it to power on straight to your cable/video game/ etc. Again decent nothing super","neutral"
"Wouldn’t buy it again","Tv is okay but I’ve had SO many freezing/pausing/buffering issues with my apps like Netflix/Hulu/YouTube. I upgraded internet and had the technicians come out here twice trying to figure out why there were so many issues with the tv streaming. The day I bought an XBOX and started streaming everything through the apps that console offers the issues stopped. It was explained to me that this tv is not dual band and the Xbox is. Basically I wouldn’t buy this tv again if I knew the problems I’d have but it is okay for now with my Xbox setup.","neutral"
"TV great. Roku not so great. TV guide totally obnoxious.","A great TV. And I really like Roku. Except for their TV guide function. And it is totally obnoxious. You have no control over what shows up in the guide and it keeps changing. Channels appear and disappear depending on how much you watch them I guess although it seems totally arbitrary. Why they don't just let you set up your own guide or just include all the channels I have no idea. But it is constantly obnoxious and would keep me from buying this TV again. But as I say the TV itself is great. And I really like ROKU outside of the TV guide.","neutral"
"Volume Issue: Resolution","Just bought the TV 4 months ago and tonight the volume went really loud on it's own and can't be adjusted down.  Remote won't adjust it either up or down and neither will the buttons on the TV.  So loud you can't even watch it.  So disappointed.UPDATE:  Was contacted by TCL to try unplugging the TV and plugging it back in.  That worked so i am changing my review from one star to 3 stars.  Shouldn't happen in the first place but TCL's customer service on this issue was stellar.","neutral"
"Cincerned about it long term","For the price it's not terrible. It's the perfect size in my opinion for a child's room. I love the Smart features and the price point. I don't love that we've owned the tv less than a week and it's already frozen twice. I have serious concerns about longevity. Also the picture is not great again what I would expect at the price point though so no serious complaints about that","neutral"
"Large disappointment when I was setting it up with my LAN","Setup was very simple with Roku's web interface. I was able to link it to my existing account quickly.  Large disappointment when I was setting it up with my LAN.  There is no Ethernet port. Wireless only.  DHCP only on your wireless network. Assigning a proper IP for your network is unavailable.Kinda a deal breaker if I had known ahead of time. One does not expect a internet device to not have a Ethernet port with the ability to assign an IP address. I will use it somewhere else where network functionality and security are not an issue.","neutral"
"First tv was broken had to send back","The TV is great but the reason I rated three stars is because the first time the TV was delivered the screen was bent and cracked all over. I sent it back and the second arrIved in perfect condition. The inconvenience of receiving a broken product is why I gave a three star rating. Only time will tell if the tv works in the long run. The TV is very light and the picture quality is clear as day.  A lot of reviews have received broken TVs. You would think they would repackage better 🤷🏽‍♀️","neutral"
"Good for the money but slow and buggy.","The picture of the TV is wonderful and it's a really light tv so It's easy to install. The problem is that the tv is a little slow and lags sometimes. Also I'm having an issue where some of the apps I downloaded don't even show up on the home page. Seems to have a lot of software issues.Also I had an issue where netflix would cause the TV to crash to the homepage but I fixed that through turning off test participation on my netflix account. Shouldn't be happening in the first place though. Decent TV though.","neutral"
"Ehhh","So far this Roku TV has been buffering like crazy.It buffered for about 2 minutes during Game of Thrones. I wanted to throw the TV out the window. If this keeps acting up I'm going to have to get a replacement. If you're considering buying this television get insurance along with it","neutral"
"Goob bedroom TV...","Good bang for the buck for its intended use.  Admittedly it is not a home theater type TV so my expectations were met.  We have an older G band router so I had some concern about whether the Roku TV would play well with it but it functions seamlessly.  This TV replaced an older 480i TV in our bedroom and met expectations.  720p resolution is ok for our use...obviously much better than the 480i","neutral"
"Tv Great! --- ROKU Meh!","So I have had a 42 LG 720P TV for the last decade and decided it was time to upgrade to 1080P as well as lose the media center PC and go with built in. I am sorry on most fronts. For a CHEAP TV this unit is great but it has a lot of quarks that I can live without.PRO:-Great 1080P picture-Easy enough to use-Light (Old set was pushing 60 lbs)CON:-ROKU is slow. Every function you press you have to wait on.-About every 4-5 days the unit will FREEZE up and reboot itself. GREAT while watching Live TV Channels-About Every 2 weeks this unit DUMPS all of your saved credentials for channels like NETFLIX CBS ABC TBS ETC and you have to enter them in for each stupid channel. Friggin pain!-Some commercials programs etc must be broadcast in 480P and this thing doesn't know what to do with it. The first few times I felt like I was back in the 80's watching my 19 Tube. That got old quick.Best I can do is give this 3 stars right now. Seriously if this unit came without the ROKU I would give it 5 stars but this is a killer for me.","neutral"
"I do like that your inputs become like an app","The Roku interface is just okay - no special. I do like that your inputs become like an app so everything is the same design. For the price it's an excellent deal. The picture quality is just okay. I turned on the movie mode for all shows and that made it a lot better. Also I turned off the smart energy off setting.","neutral"
"CAVEAT - Okay for the Price but Has One Major Drawback","It's okay but has one major drawback. You can't use a cable/DirectTV/Uverse remote because of the built-in Roku feature. Every time you turn it on you have to use the TV's Roku-style remote to select what you want to watch. It's a bit of a pain in the you-know-what.Other than that the picture quality is okay for the bedroom and you really can't beat the price for what you get.","neutral"
"Disappointed","We have a larger TCL in our living room. And because we loved it so much we decided to buy the 32 inch for another room. We were disappointed. The tv lags terribly so you can have virtually no channels on it. Our larger TCL has no problems at all with lagging or content.","neutral"
"ROKU functionality is broken.  It is TCL's fault by their own admission.  No ETA on fix.","Great TV.  Great Price.  Beautiful picture.  Picked up 30 plus over the air channels with a simple antenna. Crystal clear and solid.  Easy to use remote.  The built in ROKU functionality doesn't work.  Very annoying and disappointing.  The support site says they are working on it and not to contact them.  Finds the witless and connects no problem.  Will not update the ROKU software.  Error 005.  The built in Roku functionality was a big selling point.  It is very disappointing to open a new product and find it to be broken right away.  There is no ETA on the fix.","neutral"
"easy setup; sound isn't great","easy setup at home; light weight; mounted on the articulating wall mount easily. Easy ROKU connection. I use it only for Amazon Prime Video and Pandora and to connect to my iPad. Works good but the sound system isn't so great; just okay. the picture quality is pretty good but not spectacular","neutral"
"So our tv came today box showed up with ...","So our tv came today box showed up with a huge tear in it somehow the tv still kinda works. No pixels ruined but it will reboot by itself when you wait for it to turn on. Rebooted when we were looking on netflix for something to watch.Something heavy and metal had to have fallen on it during the shipment.","neutral"
"High Value With Caveats As Far As I'm Concerned","This is a purchase that I’m going to go into hoping for the best as I have never seen a TCL HDTV before.  I think by reading a number of reviews I know enough of what to expect and I must say the reviews played into my decision as there were almost all pretty positive.This HDTV replaces a Sceptre I have had for about six years.  Last week it just turned itself off never to come on with any amount of coaxing.  Could it be an internal fuse?  My wife said it happened as there was a small thunderstorm.  Nothing else in the house was affected so I’m inclined to think it was something internally wearing out more than being weather related.  I have got to say it’s hard to be excited about a 32” TV HD or otherwise..  It’s mostly just the only size that can fit into a bookcase cabinet which was designed when TVs were all tubes as in when  a huge TV was a 4:3 aspect 35” tabletop model.  In other words a 16:9 ratio HDTV will only fit if it’s 32” or smaller.  That brought me to looking a Amazon’s choices.I think I would rather have a $300 Sony but I’m a realist and knowy that at a small 32” size any differences will be lessened just by the size  I will only compare this to the previous Sceptre.  Out of the box it is noticeable brighter and the picture is sharper to the point of a small amount of residual grain (i.e. noise).  I do not find this better  yet it is acceptable.  The next thing is the TV more or less forced me to connect to the internet.  Perhaps I could have worked around this but I was in a hurry and I went with it.  The TV said it was updating.  I selected most of the smart TV features and I admit it was nice to be able to connect to Netflix on this one as the Sceptre wasn’t so equipped.  To me it’s a quirk that each time I turn the TV on I have to select my input choice (surely this can be corrected?).  I feel it should auto default to the last used input.  The other thing I’ve notice is that my Uverse remote would control my former Sceptre’s on/off and volume as expected so I could store that remote which was good.  On the TCL I”ve had trouble finding an the appropriate program for the Uverse remote.  Finally I found one though it worked it worked only partially.  The on/off isn’t working for the TV on the Uverse remote as expected and the volume requires that you use the TCL’s remote to pre-set  the TV's volume at about 80% and then the Uverse volume will work kind of indepenttly of this - adjusting the volume whilet not actually changing the set’s 80% volume - strange!I think my set looks OK with decent detail and blacks are somewhat detailed so they're not simply a black blob.  Out of the box it’s too bright and is too sharp.  I will later bother to actually read the instruction manual with hopes to tame these parameters.  This set isn’t any kind of close to “state of the art” and at $170 I wouldn’t expect it to be.  it is good enough to do what I need most and for that I give it 3-stars.  If the input defaulted and the remote codes worked it would bump up to a 4-star set due to low cost and acceptable performance.  It could never IMHO be a 5-star 32” set however.  As it is though it’s a decent set at a strong value price with the smart and wi-fi features of ROKU TV being built in thus I’m satisfied enough at the price.","neutral"
"frustrated with remote","I just set it up which took forever since the remote doesn't work very well.  You have to push the button many times to get it to  move to another letter.  Why they make such a bad remote is beyond me.  I have roku remotes that I use on other tvs and they work fine but this one is awful.  They need to make a better one.  I upped it to 3 stars outside of the remote it's an ok tv.","negative"
"Ok ok!!","I am not sure if it's the TV Roku or Netflix.  But lately it's been exiting to the main screen mid-streaming. I'm not able to locate it on my Roku remote phone app anymore either.Update 1/15/18: the exiting issue fixed itself but the remote it came with stopped working. Tried replacing batteries didn't help.","neutral"
"The TV is a nice size and was really excited to use it","would have given it a 3 and a half but that not a option. The TV is a nice size and was really excited to use it. After about a month the apps wanna act crazy and I get kicked off NETFLIX and VUDU all the time so I got myself a amazon stick to at least watch Netflix. Other than a  app problem the color is great and so is the picture just wish it would work the way I need.","neutral"
"Smart TV????","This is described as a Roku TV. It comes with a Roku remote that has the shortcut buttons like Amazon Netflix Slingtv and so on. These apps are supposed to be preloaded on the tv. I’ve been using slingtv for more than a year and thought this would be a nice tv to have. Well slingtv is not preloaded and you can’t even load. You go to apps thinking you can load it and all you get is an advertisement for slingtv. Finally got it working but only by hooking up slingtv the normal way by plugging in a Roku hdmi and using that Roku remote. But you have to use the Roku remote to select the hdmi that slingtv is on and then change over to using the other Roku remote to make you channel selections.  So much for being a smart tv.","neutral"
"meh","Two months in and sometimes it looks great and some scenes look like old 80s movies. Sometimes for very dark shots the color looks off. It not horrible but it is cheap.","neutral"
"Its ok Please read review.","Had to return tv because of a popping sound it kept making. Amazon was good to replace it right away. Picture quality not great though but you get what you pay for.","neutral"
